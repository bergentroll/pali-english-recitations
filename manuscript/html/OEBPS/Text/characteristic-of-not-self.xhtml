  <center>〈 Thus have I heard 〉</center>

  <p>On one occasion<a href="endnotes.xhtml#en108"><sup>108</sup></a> the Blessed One was dwelling at Benares <span class="breathmark">’</span> in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There he addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five: “Bhikkhus” – “Venerable Sir” they replied. The Blessed One said this:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#en109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>

  <p>Bhikkhus form is not-self. If form were self <span class="breathmark">’</span> then form would not lead to affliction <span class="breathmark">’</span> and one could command to form: “Let my form be thus <span class="breathmark">’</span> let my form not be thus.”<br/> But since form is not-self <span class="breathmark">’</span> it leads to affliction <span class="breathmark">’</span> and none can command to form: “Let my form be thus <span class="breathmark">’</span> let my form not be thus.”</p>

  <p>Feeling is not-self. If feeling were self <span class="breathmark">’</span> then feeling would not lead to affliction <span class="breathmark">’</span> and one could command to feeling: “Let my feeling be thus <span class="breathmark">’</span> let my feeling not be thus.”<br/> But since feeling is not-self <span class="breathmark">’</span> it leads to affliction <span class="breathmark">’</span> and none can command to feeling: “Let my feeling be thus <span class="breathmark">’</span> let my feeling not be thus.”</p>

  <p>Perception is not-self. If perception were self <span class="breathmark">’</span> then perception would not lead to affliction <span class="breathmark">’</span> and one could command to perception: “Let my perception be thus <span class="breathmark">’</span> let my perception not be thus.”<br/> But since perception is not-self <span class="breathmark">’</span> it leads to affliction <span class="breathmark">’</span> and none can command to perception: “Let my perception be thus <span class="breathmark">’</span> let my perception not be thus.”</p>

  <p>Volitional formations are not-self. If volitional formations were self <span class="breathmark">’</span> then volitional formations would not lead to affliction <span class="breathmark">’</span> and one could command to volitional formations: “Let my volitional formations be thus <span class="breathmark">’</span> let my volitional formations not be thus.”<br/> But since volitional formations are not-self <span class="breathmark">’</span> they lead to affliction <span class="breathmark">’</span> and none can command to volitional formations: “Let my volitional formations be thus <span class="breathmark">’</span> let my volitional formations not be thus.”</p>

  <p>Consciousness is not-self. If consciousness were self <span class="breathmark">’</span> then consciousness would not lead to affliction <span class="breathmark">’</span> and one could command to consciousness: “Let my consciousness be thus <span class="breathmark">’</span> let my consciousness not be thus.”<br/> But since consciousness is not-self <span class="breathmark">’</span> it leads to affliction <span class="breathmark">’</span> and none can command to consciousness: “Let my consciousness be thus <span class="breathmark">’</span> let my consciousness not be thus.”</p>

  <center>〈 Bhikkhus what do you think: 〉</center>

  “Is form permanent or impermanent?”\ “Impermanent venerable Sir.”\ “Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?”\ “Unsatisfactory venerable Sir.”\ “Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine <span class="breathmark">’</span> this I am <span class="breathmark">’</span> this is my self?'”\ “No venerable Sir.” 

  <p>Bhikkhus what do you think: “Is feeling permanent or impermanent?”<br/> “Impermanent venerable Sir.”<br/> “Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?”<br/> “Unsatisfactory venerable Sir.”<br/> “Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine <span class="breathmark">’</span> this I am <span class="breathmark">’</span> this is my self?'”<br/> “No venerable Sir.”</p>

  <p>Bhikkhus what do you think: “Is perception permanent or impermanent?”<br/> “Impermanent venerable Sir.”<br/> “Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?”<br/> “Unsatisfactory venerable Sir.”<br/> “Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine <span class="breathmark">’</span> this I am <span class="breathmark">’</span> this is my self?'<br/> “No venerable Sir.”</p>

  <p>Bhikkhus what do you think: “Are volitional formations permanent or impermanent?”<br/> “Impermanent venerable Sir.”<br/> “Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?”<br/> “Unsatisfactory venerable Sir.”<br/> “Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine <span class="breathmark">’</span> this I am <span class="breathmark">’</span> this is my self?'”<br/> “No venerable Sir.”</p>

  <p>Bhikkhus what do you think: “Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?”<br/> “Impermanent venerable Sir.”<br/> “Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?”<br/> “Unsatisfactory venerable Sir.”<br/> “Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine <span class="breathmark">’</span> this I am <span class="breathmark">’</span> this is my self?'<br/> “No venerable Sir.”</p>

  <center>〈 Therefore bhikkhus 〉</center>

  Any kind of form whatsoever <span class="breathmark">’</span> whether past future or present <span class="breathmark">’</span> internal or external <span class="breathmark">’</span> gross or subtle <span class="breathmark">’</span> inferior or superior <span class="breathmark">’</span> far or near <span class="breathmark">’</span> must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: “This is not mine <span class="breathmark">’</span> this I am not <span class="breathmark">’</span> this is not my self.” 

  <p>Any kind of feeling whatsoever <span class="breathmark">’</span> whether past future or present <span class="breathmark">’</span> internal or external <span class="breathmark">’</span> gross or subtle <span class="breathmark">’</span> inferior or superior <span class="breathmark">’</span> far or near <span class="breathmark">’</span> must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: “This is not mine <span class="breathmark">’</span> this I am not <span class="breathmark">’</span> this is not my self.”</p>

  <p>Any kind of perception whatsoever <span class="breathmark">’</span> whether past future or present <span class="breathmark">’</span> internal or external <span class="breathmark">’</span> gross or subtle <span class="breathmark">’</span> inferior or superior <span class="breathmark">’</span> far or near <span class="breathmark">’</span> must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: “This is not mine <span class="breathmark">’</span> this I am not <span class="breathmark">’</span> this is not my self.”</p>

  <p>Any kind of volitional formation whatsoever <span class="breathmark">’</span> whether past future or present <span class="breathmark">’</span> internal or external <span class="breathmark">’</span> gross or subtle <span class="breathmark">’</span> inferior or superior <span class="breathmark">’</span> far or near <span class="breathmark">’</span> must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: “This is not mine <span class="breathmark">’</span> this I am not <span class="breathmark">’</span> this is not my self.”</p>

  <p>Any kind of consciousness whatsoever <span class="breathmark">’</span> whether past future or present <span class="breathmark">’</span> internal or external <span class="breathmark">’</span> gross or subtle <span class="breathmark">’</span> inferior or superior <span class="breathmark">’</span> far or near <span class="breathmark">’</span> must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: “This is not mine <span class="breathmark">’</span> this I am not <span class="breathmark">’</span> this is not my self.”</p>

  <center>〈 Bhikkhus when a noble disciple<a href="endnotes.xhtml#en110"><sup>110</sup></a> 〉</center>

  Who has heard the teaching<a href="endnotes.xhtml#en111"><sup>111</sup></a> sees thus <span class="breathmark">’</span> he becomes disenchanted with form <span class="breathmark">’</span> becomes disenchanted with feeling <span class="breathmark">’</span> becomes disenchanted with perception <span class="breathmark">’</span> becomes disenchanted with volitional formations <span class="breathmark">’</span> becomes disenchanted with consciousness. 

  <p>When he is disenchanted passion fades away. With the fading of passion he is liberated. When liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated. He understands: “Birth is exhausted <span class="breathmark">’</span> the holy life is fulfilled <span class="breathmark">’</span> what has to be done is done <span class="breathmark">’</span> there is nothing else to do for the sake of liberation.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#en112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

  <p>That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus of the group of five were glad and they approved of his words. Now during this utterance <span class="breathmark">’</span> the hearts of the bhikkhus of the group of five <span class="breathmark">’</span> were liberated from the taints through the cessation of clinging.</p>
