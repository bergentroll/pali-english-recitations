  <p><a href="acknowledgments.xhtml#en1" id="en1appendix"><sup>1</sup></a> Due to the balanced and inspiring selection of chants, as well as for the sake of compatability, WPN <i>Buddhist Chanting</i> (2014) has served as the basis for this book. Over time, suggestions for the inclusion of additional chants, as well as occasional improvements of existing translations were incorporated. Such changes were meticulously marked down in the endnotes, so that someone familiar with the present book can straight away find the relevant differences, which can be useful when visiting a branch monastery of the Ajahn Chah lineage, in order to know in which places to revert to the original version.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p><a href="dedication-of-offerings.xhtml#en2" id="en2appendix"><sup>2</sup></a> WPN: “The Lord”. The underlying Pāli term is “<em>Arahant</em>”. “Lord”, however, has connotations that do not fit well to the way the Buddha is portrayed in the discourses. In dictionaries “lord” is commonly defined as: “<em>an appellation for a person or deity who has authority, control, or power over others, acting like a master, a chief, or a ruler.” The “Worthy One” seems a better choice of terms, since it is also how <em>`</em>‘Arahant’’ was used in pre-Buddhist era. PTS explains: “[Vedic arhant, ppr. of arhati (see arahati), meaning deserving, worthy]. Before Buddhism used as honourific title of high officials like the English “His Worship” ; at the rise of Buddhism applied popularly to all ascetics (Dial. III.3–6).”</em> Throughout this chanting book, all occurrences of “<em>Arahant</em>” have therefore been consistently translated as “Worthy One”, thus substituting previous translations as “The Lord”, “Noble One” etc.</p>

  <p><a href="homage-buddha.xhtml#en3" id="en3appendix"><sup>3</sup></a> WPN: “He trains perfectly those who wish to be trained”. The aspect of wishing to be trained is not found in the Pāli.</p>

  <p><a href="homage-buddha.xhtml#en4" id="en4appendix"><sup>4</sup></a> WPN: “He has explained the spiritual life of complete purity”. While “spiritual life” is not a bad translation, for the sake of consistency with the rest of the chanting book, this occurrence was changed to “holy life”</p>

  <p><a href="homage-sangha.xhtml#en5" id="en5appendix"><sup>5</sup></a> To practice “directly”(Pāli: <em>uju</em>) means, to practice the most direct way to <em>nibbāna</em>; the straight way; no detours.</p>

  <p><a href="respect-for-the-dhamma.xhtml#en31" id="en31appendix"><sup>31</sup></a> WPN: “lack of Dhamma” This translation is problematic, because a mere “lack of Dhamma” does not lead to rebirth in hell; otherwise all non-Buddhists would be destined to hell. In reality, it is the view and practice of “wrong Dhamma” that leads to hell, which is also substantiated by the Commentary, which defines “adhamma” as the opposite (<em>paṭipakkha</em>) of true Dhamma.</p>

  <p><a href="true-false-refuges.xhtml#en32" id="en32appendix"><sup>32</sup></a> This line is missing in Wat Pah Nanachat chanting book.</p>

  <p><a href="patimokkha-exhortation.xhtml#en33" id="en33appendix"><sup>33</sup></a> WPN: “from suffering”</p>

  <p><a href="three-characteristics.xhtml#en34" id="en34appendix"><sup>34</sup></a> There are two variations as to the sequence of these three verses. The sequence used here follows the sequence of Dhp 183 (<em>Sabba pāpassa</em>...), Dhp 184 (<em>Khantī paramaṁ</em>...), Dhp 185 (<em>Anūpavādo</em>...). In contrast, the sequence Dhp 184, 183, 185 is commonly known as the “<em>Ovādapātimokkha</em>”, and occurs at DN 14.</p>

  <p><a href="three-characteristics.xhtml#en35" id="en35appendix"><sup>35</sup></a> WPN: “Impermanent are all conditioned things”</p>

  <p><a href="three-characteristics.xhtml#en36" id="en36appendix"><sup>36</sup></a> “Dukkha” here refers to the five aggregates themselves, as explained in SN 56.11: “The five aggregates of clinging are dukkha”. Along similar lines, the five aggregates are called “burdens” in SN 22.22.</p>

  <p><a href="three-characteristics.xhtml#en37" id="en37appendix"><sup>37</sup></a> WPN: “Dukkha are all conditioned things”</p>

  <p><a href="three-characteristics.xhtml#en38" id="en38appendix"><sup>38</sup></a> WPN: “From the floods dry land they reach”</p>

  <p><a href="protection.xhtml#en40" id="en40appendix"><sup>40</sup></a> WPN: “The beast of burden though is man”. The Pāli word “<em>puggalo</em>” stands in masculine, which is the expected grammatical form even if a term refers to males and females alike, as is probably the case here. Furthermore, the phrase “beast of burden” is an English idiomatic expression, signifying “an animal used for heavy work such as carrying or pulling things” (Oxford dictionary).</p>

  <p><a href="protection.xhtml#en41" id="en41appendix"><sup>41</sup></a> ‘Unity’here refers to unity of mind due to concentration (<em>samādhi</em>, <em>cittass-ekaggatā</em>). <em>Nekatta</em> = <em>na</em> + <em>ekatta</em> [abstr. fr. <em>eka</em>].</p>

  <p><a href="misc-verses.xhtml#en42" id="en42appendix"><sup>42</sup></a> WPN: “The dust of passions all the more”. The Pāli only speaks of stirring up dust, but the commentary explains that it refers to the dust of <em>kilesā</em>. As a translation for <em>kilesā</em>, the term “defilements” has a broader scope than just “passions, wherefore the former has been given preference.</p>

  <p><a href="single-excellent-night.xhtml#en43" id="en43appendix"><sup>43</sup></a> The meaning of this statement is somewhat cryptic. The Commentary explains as follows: <em>pamādo rajo</em> = heedlessness is dust; <em>pamādo Pamād’ānupatito rajo</em> = the dust that follows heedlessness is (also) heedlessness; the Commentary further explains that this is about procrastination e.g. “I am still young, so can afford to be heedless; maybe later I’ll be heedful”.</p>

  <p><a href="single-excellent-night.xhtml#en44" id="en44appendix"><sup>44</sup></a> WPN: “Such insight is one’s strength”</p>

  <p><a href="highest-blessings.xhtml#en46" id="en46appendix"><sup>46</sup></a> WPN: “a shining night of prosperty”</p>

  <p><a href="highest-blessings.xhtml#en47" id="en47appendix"><sup>47</sup></a> “The term “blessing” is used throughout this chanting book to convey the meaning of “support”, or “a beneficial thing”, without implying the underlying Christian connotations this term may have in popular use.</p>

  <p><a href="highest-blessings.xhtml#en48" id="en48appendix"><sup>48</sup></a> WPN: “Was staying at Sāvatthī”</p>

  <p><a href="words-on-loving-kindness.xhtml#en49" id="en49appendix"><sup>49</sup></a> WPN: “Even”</p>

  <p><a href="words-on-loving-kindness.xhtml#en50" id="en50appendix"><sup>50</sup></a> WPN: “to fixed views”. This paragraph deals with <em>Anāgāmis</em>, which becomes apparent from the closing statement in which it is said that by this practice one becomes free from sense desires and is not born again into this world (sense sphere). The limitation of loving-kindness practice leading “only” up to <em>Anāgāmihood</em> also finds confirmation by AN 4.126. Now, since an <em>Anāgāmi</em> has right view, which is the first factor of the noble eightfold path (even <em>Arahants</em> hold right view; AN 10.112), it would therefore not be correct to say that he holds no views at all. Furthermore, even an <em>Anāgāmi</em> may still have some minor grasping to (right) view, as there can still be moments of <em>māna</em> (identification/conceit), which is overcome only by the <em>Arahant</em>. I therefore conclude that this passage here refers specifically to “wrong views” and does not include “right view”, since wrong views are the only types of views that an <em>Anāgāmi</em> has entirely left behind.</p>

  <p><a href="wheel-of-dhamma-abridged.xhtml#en51" id="en51appendix"><sup>51</sup></a> WPN: “It is this Noble Eightfold Path”</p>

  <p><a href="wheel-of-dhamma-abridged.xhtml#en52" id="en52appendix"><sup>52</sup></a> For some reason “<em>byādhi’pi dukkho</em>” is missing from the WPN version of this chanting book. The reason for this omission is unclear, because even the Thai edition of this discourse contains “<em>byādhi’pi dukkho</em>”. However, the definition of the four noble truths in the context of the <em>Satipaṭṭhānasuttas</em> in DN and MN do not contain “<em>byādhi’pi dukkho</em>”. It may be that the compilers of this chanting book copy/pasted this passage from the wrong discourse, thinking it is the same anayway, whereas in reality there is this small difference.</p>

  <p><a href="wheel-of-dhamma-abridged.xhtml#en53" id="en53appendix"><sup>53</sup></a> WPN: “grief”</p>

  <p><a href="wheel-of-dhamma-abridged.xhtml#en57" id="en57appendix"><sup>57</sup></a> The three phases are comprised of the statement of the noble truth itself, followed by what is the task that is to be performed in relation to this noble truth, followed by the statement that the task has been performed. Four truths multiplied by three phases, results in 12 aspects.</p>

  <p><a href="wheel-of-dhamma-abridged.xhtml#en58" id="en58appendix"><sup>58</sup></a> Instead of the nominative “<em>abhisambuddo</em>” (Thai and Buddha Jayanti Pāli edition), one would usually expect the accusative or a quotation here, which is indeed what is found in the PTS and Chatta Saṅgāyana editions, giving “<em>abhisambuddho’ti</em>”. However, the anoumolous reading “<em>abhisambuddho</em>” finds support from <em>Mahāvasutu</em>: “<em>yāvac cāhaṁ bhikṣavaḥ imāni catvāry āryasatyāni evaṁ triparivartaṁ dvādaśākāraṁ yathābhūtaṁ samyakprajñayā nābhyajñāsiṣaṁ na tāvad ahaṁ anuttarāṁ samyaksaṁbodhim abhisaṁbuddho pratijānehaṁ</em>”, which according to Ven. Ānandajoti probably indicates that “<em>abhisambuddho</em>” is an old/original reading.</p>

  <p><a href="gradual-training.xhtml#en59" id="en59appendix"><sup>59</sup></a> WPN: [those people]. Removed brackets for the sake of recitability.</p>

  <p><a href="gradual-training.xhtml#en60" id="en60appendix"><sup>60</sup></a> Contrary to popular belief, mindfulness and full awareness is not meant to be practiced while sleeping, but only before falling asleep and after waking up.</p>

  <p><a href="noble-eightfold-path.xhtml#en62" id="en62appendix"><sup>62</sup></a> WPN: “covetousness and grief”</p>

  <p><a href="noble-eightfold-path.xhtml#en63" id="en63appendix"><sup>63</sup></a> WPN: “He abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects”. Since “mind-object” is not an ideal translation for “<em>dhamma</em>” in this context, it is preferable to leave “<em>dhamma</em>” untranslated here.</p>

  <p><a href="noble-eightfold-path.xhtml#en64" id="en64appendix"><sup>64</sup></a> “Quite secluded from sense pleasures” means being completely and entirely secluded; not just somewhat/moderately secluded. The Pāli term ‘<em>eva</em>’, which has been translated as ‘quite’ is an emphatic particle, intensifying the adjective it qualifies. Acc. to Oxford English Dictionary, the English term ‘quite’has two connotations: 1. to the utmost or most absolute extent or degree; absolutely; completely; 2. To a certain or fairly significant extent or degree; fairly. It is the first connotation in which ‘quite’is used in the phrase “quite secluded from sense pleasures”.</p>

  <p><a href="noble-eightfold-path.xhtml#en65" id="en65appendix"><sup>65</sup></a> WPN: “Still feeling pleasure with the body”. The Pāli doesn’t say “still”, but more importantly SN 48.40 states that physical pleasure (sukha) has ceased in 3rd Jhāna, and mental pleasure (<em>somanassa</em>) has ceased in 4th Jhāna. Therefore, according to SN 48.40 <em>kāya</em> in the context of the 3rd Jhāna stock formula cannot refer to the physical body. The Pāli commentaries agree, and explain that “<em>kāya</em>” here refers to the ‘mental body’, in particular to mental pleasure (<em>somanassa</em>). However, a comparative study by Prof. Kuan Tse-Fu titled <em>“Clarification on Feelings in Buddhist Dhyāna/Jhāna Meditation”</em> brought to light that the Chinese parallel to SN 48.40 has a different sequence of disappearing types of <em>vedanā</em> in the sequence of the four Jhānas. While it would go beyond the scope of this footnote to discuss the matter in detail, it is noteworthy that the parallel to SN 48.40, the <em>Aviparātaka Sūtra</em> of the <em>Āgamas</em>, indeed mentions that bodily pleasant feeling (<em>sukha</em>) disappears only in the 4th Jhāna, whereas mental pleasant feeling (<em>somanassa</em>) has disappeared already in the 3rd Jhāna, alongside with the disappearance of <em>pīti</em>. In the context of this chanting book, we have therefore chosen to stay with the literal translation of the word “<em>kāya</em>” as “body”, and invite the reader to draw his own conclusions.</p>

  <p><a href="mindfulness-of-breathing.xhtml#en69" id="en69appendix"><sup>69</sup></a> WPN: “I shall breathe in experiencing the mental formations”. <em>Cittasaṅkhāraṁ</em> is probably meant to be singular, not plural. This is not clear when looking at compounds, however, considering that the subsequent practice explicitly uses mental formation in “singular <em>cittasaṅkhāraṁ</em>”, this suggests that it is probably used in the same way here.</p>

  <p><a href="mindfulness-of-breathing.xhtml#en70" id="en70appendix"><sup>70</sup></a> WPN: “I shall breathe in tranquillising the mental formations”. <em>Cittasaṅkhāraṁ</em> is singular, not plural.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en71" id="en71appendix"><sup>71</sup></a> Lit.: “the ‘Discourse Analysis’&#160;from the ‘Analysis of Dependent Origination’”; the “Discourse Analysis” is a sub-chapter (Abh.Vibh.130f) from the “Analysis of Dependent Origination”, which is part of the 2nd book of the <em>Abhidhammapiṭaka</em> called the “<em>Vibhaṅga</em>”. Apart from minor variations, there is great similarity between this analysis and the analysis found in SN 12.2, as part of the <em>Suttapiṭaka</em>.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en72" id="en72appendix"><sup>72</sup></a> Here and at other places of the English translation, the term “a condition” is used. The indefinite article “a” indicates, that there could be other conditions as well (e.g. all previous conditions in the sequence are a condition for all subsequent ones), but the directly aforementioned condition is the predominant one (<em>adhipati-paccaya</em>) for the subsequent conditioned thing to arise.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en73" id="en73appendix"><sup>73</sup></a> Here and at other places of the English translation, the term “arises” is inserted, because the term “<em>sambhavati</em>” from “<em>Jāti-paccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ; soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass’upāyāsā sambhavanti</em>” applies to all 11 links (12 minus ignorance) and not only to ageing-and-death etc.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en74" id="en74appendix"><sup>74</sup></a> In the context of dependent origination, the compound “<em>nāmarūpa</em>” is translated as “mind-and-body” in order to cover the entirety of what is conventionally called “a being, a person”. In other contexts, particularly if used separately, these terms may have other connotations.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en75" id="en75appendix"><sup>75</sup></a> Here and at other places of the English translation, the term “arises” is inserted, because the term “<em>sambhavati</em>” from “<em>Jāti-paccayā jarāmaraṇaṁ; soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass’upāyāsā sambhavanti</em>” applies to all 11 links (12 minus ignorance) and not only to ageing-and-death etc.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en76" id="en76appendix"><sup>76</sup></a> To render as “Therein what is from ignorance as a condition arise formations.” would be misleading, because it is not the conditioned relationship between A and B (here: ignorance and formations) that gets elaborated upon in the following lines, but it is only the term B (here: formations), that gets defined. Hence the preferable translation: “Therein what are ’formations’, arising from ignorance as a condition?”</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en77" id="en77appendix"><sup>77</sup></a> SN 12.51 explains: “Bhikkhus, if a person immersed in ignorance generates a meritorious volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the meritorious; if he generates a demeritorious volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the demeritorious; if he generates an imperturbable volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the imperturbable.”</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en78" id="en78appendix"><sup>78</sup></a> Further explained in SN 12.25</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en79" id="en79appendix"><sup>79</sup></a> <em>Manosañcetanā cittasaṅkhāro</em> is translated here as “volition associated with the mind is the mental formation”. Despite of mano and citta having in certain contexts different shades of meaning, both were translated here as “mind”. Generally speaking mano refers more to the intellectual, whereas citta covers more the emotional/affective aspects of the mind. A detailed analysis of these terms can be found in Rune E. A. Johansson’s “<em>Citta, Mano, Viññāṇa — a Psychosemantic Investigation</em>”.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en80" id="en80appendix"><sup>80</sup></a> While Vibh 130 introduces a new definition for <em>nāma</em> as “<em>vedanākkhandho</em>, <em>saññākkhandho</em>, <em>saṅkhārakkhandho</em>,” this definition stands in tension with the discourses, where <em>nāma</em> is consistently defined as <em>vedanā</em>, <em>saññā</em>, <em>cetanā</em>, <em>phassa</em>, <em>manasikāra</em> (e.g. MN 9, SN 12.2). It is for this reason that the passage from Vibh 130 was replaced with the 5-fold nāma as found throughout the suttas.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en81" id="en81appendix"><sup>81</sup></a> The term <em>vāda</em> in <em>attavādupādāna</em> does here not necessarily refer to “a doctrine” of self, but rather to a person’s sense of being someone; the sense of being or having a self. This is not exactly the same as personality view, which is destroyed already at the stage of stream-entry. The lingering sense of having a self may continue for a while, despite of having already intellectually and/or experientially understood that there is no self to be found in relation to the five aggregates; just as conceit (<em>māna</em>) is overcome only by the path to <em>Arahantship</em>, despite of having uprooted personality view already at the stage of stream-entry.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en82" id="en82appendix"><sup>82</sup></a> Here the Vibh. differs substantially from the analysis found in the suttas. It introduces a distinction between action becoming (<em>kammabhava</em>) and rebirth becoming (<em>upapattipbhava</em>). <em>Kammabhava</em> is taken to refer to wholesome, unwholesome and imperturpable actions; <em>upapattibhava</em> is taken to refer to sense/form/formless-sphere becoming, percipient/non-percipient/neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient becoming, one/four/five-component becoming. But since AN 3.76 says that <em>kamma</em> (together with consciousness and craving) is a condition for <em>bhava</em> (if no <em>kamma</em>...then no becoming in the sense-sphere etc. would be discerned), it is not fit to say that <em>kamma</em> itself is a form of <em>bhava</em> (<em>kammabhava</em>). However, it would go too far for the purpose of this chanting book, to discuss further implications of the analysis found in Vibh. For the sake of simplicity and emphasis on the earliest strata of the Buddha’s teachings, we substituted the passage from Vibh. with the passage from SN 12.2, which defines becoming (<em>bhava</em>) simply as sense/form/formless-sphere becoming. Understood in this way, becoming (<em>bhava</em>) functions as an intermediary between clinging and birth, highlighting the gradual process of how rebirth in one of the three planes of existence takes place. This can even include an interim period between death and birth; thus it is called “becoming”, rather than instant birth straight after death.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en83" id="en83appendix"><sup>83</sup></a> While SN 12.2 does not contain a full elaboration on all types of <em>dukkha</em>, a similar analysis is found in DN 22.</p>

  <p><a href="dependent-origination.xhtml#en84" id="en84appendix"><sup>84</sup></a> While SN 12.2 does not contain an elaboration on the different types of misfortune (<em>vyasana</em>), it is found in DN 33, AN 4.192, and AN 5.130. <em>Diṭṭhi</em> here does not mean just any view, but “right view”. The loss of other views would not be particularly unfortunate from a Buddhist perspective, especially the loss of wrong view could be regarded as a great blessing. The right view that is lost in this example is not the right view of a noble disciple, but the right view of a worldling (<em>puthujjana</em>), whose right view is not unshakeable and who may or may not change his view later on throughout the course of the present life or subsequent births.</p>

Ānanda: “If, Ānanda, you visit the (severely sick) bhikkhu Girimānanda and speak to him about ten perceptions, it is possible that on hearing about them his affliction will immediately subside.” Then the same seven perceptions as above are mentioned, with the addition of the following three: 8. the perception of non-delight in the entire world; 9. the perception of impermanence in all conditioned phenomena, and 10. mindfulness of breathing. <em>Girimānandasutta</em> concludes: “Then, when the Venerable Ānanda had learned these ten perceptions from the Blessed One, he went to the Venerable Girimānanda and spoke to him about them. When the Venerable Girimānanda heard about these ten perceptions, his affliction immediately subsided.”</p>
