  <center>〈 Now let us recite the Gradual Training 〉</center>

  <p>"A householder or householder's son &#160;or one born in some other clan hears the Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the Tathāgata. Possessing that faith he considers thus: 'Household life is crowded and dusty &#160;life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy while living at home &#160;to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure &#160;as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard &#160;put on the ochre robe &#160;and go forth from home to homelessness.' On a later occasion &#160;abandoning a small or large fortune &#160;abandoning a small or large circle of relatives &#160;he shaves off his hair and beard &#160;puts on the ochre robe &#160;and goes forth from home to homelessness."</p>

  <p>"Now is it possible Master Gotama &#160;to describe a gradual training&#160;&#160;gradual practice &#160;and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Vinaya?"</p>

  <p>"It is possible to describe a gradual training &#160;gradual practice &#160;and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Vinaya. When the Tathāgata obtains a person to be tamed &#160;he first disciplines him thus: 'Come bhikkhu be virtuous &#160;dwell restrained with the restraint of the Pātimokkha &#160;perfect in conduct and resort &#160;and seeing danger in the slightest faults &#160;train by undertaking the training rules.''</p>

  <div class="suttaref">
    <p>[MN 107]</p>
  </div>

  <p>"Having thus gone forth &#160;and possessing the bhikkhus' training and way of life &#160;abandoning the destruction of life &#160;he abstains from destroying life &#160;with rod and weapon laid aside &#160;conscientious &#160;merciful &#160;he abides compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given &#160;he abstains from taking what is not given &#160;taking only what is given &#160;expecting only what is given &#160;by not stealing he abides in purity.</p>

  <p>Abandoning the household life &#160;he observes the holy life &#160;living apart &#160;abstaining from the vulgar practice of sexual intercourse."</p>

  <p>"Abandoning false speech &#160;he abstains from false speech &#160;he speaks truth&#160;&#160;adheres to truth &#160;is trustworthy and reliable &#160;one who is no deceiver of the world. Abandoning malicious speech &#160;he abstains from malicious speech &#160;he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here &#160;in order to divide those<a href="endnotes.xhtml#en59" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>59</sup></a> people from these &#160;nor does he repeat here what he has heard elsewhere &#160;in order to divide these people from those &#160;thus he is one who reunites those who are divided &#160;a promoter of friendships&#160;&#160;who enjoys unity &#160;rejoices in unity &#160;delights in unity &#160;a speaker of words that promote unity. Abandoning harsh speech &#160;he abstains from harsh speech &#160;he speaks words that are gentle &#160;pleasing to the ear &#160;and loveable&#160;&#160;that go to the heart &#160;are courteous &#160;desired by many and agreeable to many. Abandoning idle chatter &#160;he abstains from idle chatter &#160;he speaks at the right time &#160;speaks what is fact &#160;speaks on what is good &#160;speaks on the Dhamma and Vinaya &#160;at the right time &#160;he speaks words that are worth recording &#160;reasonable &#160;moderate &#160;and beneficial."</p>

  <p>"He abstains from harming seeds and plants. He practices eating one meal a day &#160;abstaining from eating at night and outside the proper time. He abstains from dancing &#160;singing &#160;music and entertainments. He abstains from wearing garlands &#160;smartening himself with scent &#160;and embellishing himself with unguents. He abstains from high and luxurious sleeping places. He abstains from accepting gold and silver. He abstains from accepting raw grain. He abstains from accepting raw meat. He abstains from accepting women and girls. He abstains from accepting men and women slaves. He abstains from accepting goats and sheep. He abstains from accepting fowl and pigs. He abstains from accepting elephants&#160;&#160;cattle &#160;horses and mares. He abstains from accepting fields and land."</p>

  <p>"He abstains from running errands and messages. He abstains from buying and selling. He abstains from false weights &#160;false metals &#160;and false measures. He abstains from accepting bribes &#160;deceiving &#160;defrauding&#160;&#160;and trickery. He abstains from wounding &#160;murdering&#160;&#160;binding &#160;robbery&#160;&#160;plunder and violence."</p>

  <p>"He becomes content with robes to protect his body &#160;and almsfood to maintain his stomach &#160;and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him. Just as a bird &#160;wherever it goes &#160;flies with its wings as its only burden &#160;so too the bhikkhu becomes content &#160;with robes to protect his body &#160;and almsfood to maintain his stomach&#160;&#160;and wherever he goes &#160;he sets out taking only these with him. Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue &#160;he experiences within himself a bliss that is blameless."</p>

  <p>"Then the Tathāgata disciplines him further: 'Come bhikkhu &#160;guard the doors of your sense faculties. On seeing a form with the eye &#160;do not grasp at its signs and features. Since if you were to leave the eye faculty unguarded &#160;evil unwholesome states of longing and grief might invade you &#160;practice the way of its restraint &#160;guard the eye faculty &#160;undertake the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear. On smelling an odour with the nose. On tasting a flavour with the tongue. On touching a tangible with the body. On cognizing a mind-object with the mind &#160;do not grasp at its signs and features. Since if you were to leave the mind faculty unguarded&#160;&#160;evil unwholesome states of longing and grief might invade you &#160;practice the way of its restraint &#160;guard the mind faculty &#160;undertake the restraint of the mind faculty.''</p>

  <p>"Come bhikkhu &#160;be moderate in eating. Wisely reflecting I use almsfood&#160;&#160;not for fun &#160;not for pleasure &#160;not for fattening &#160;not for beautification &#160;only for the maintenance and nourishment of this body &#160;for keeping it healthy &#160;for helping with the holy life &#160;thinking thus: I will allay hunger without overeating &#160;so that I may continue to live blamelessly and at ease."</p>

  <p>"Come bhikkhu &#160;be devoted to wakefulness. During the day &#160;while walking back and forth and sitting &#160;purify your mind of obstructive states. In the first watch of the night &#160;while walking back and forth and sitting &#160;purify your mind of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night &#160;you should lie down on the right side &#160;in the lion's pose &#160;with one foot overlapping the other &#160;mindful and fully aware &#160;after noting in your mind the time for rising. After rising in the third watch of the night &#160;while walking back and forth and sitting &#160;purify your mind of obstructive states."</p>

  <p>"Come bhikkhu &#160;be possessed of mindfulness and full awareness. Act in full awareness when going forward and returning &#160;act in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away &#160;act in full awareness when flexing and extending your limbs &#160;act in full awareness when wearing your robes&#160;&#160;and carrying your outer robe and bowl &#160;act in full awareness when eating&#160;&#160;drinking &#160;consuming food &#160;and tasting &#160;act in full awareness when defecating and urinating &#160;act in full awareness when walking &#160;standing&#160;&#160;sitting &#160;falling asleep &#160;waking up<a href="endnotes.xhtml#en60" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>60</sup></a> &#160;talking &#160;and keeping silent."</p>

  <p>"Come bhikkhu &#160;resort to a secluded resting place: a forest &#160;the foot of a tree &#160;a mountain &#160;a ravine &#160;a hillside cave &#160;a charnel ground &#160;a jungle thicket &#160;an open space &#160;a heap of straw."</p>

  <p>"After his meal on returning from almsround he sits down &#160;having crossed his legs &#160;sets his body erect &#160;having established mindfulness in front of him. Abandoning longing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#en61" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>61</sup></a> for the world &#160;he abides with a mind free from longing &#160;he purifies his mind from longing. Abandoning ill will and hatred &#160;he abides with a mind free from ill will &#160;compassionate for the welfare of all living beings&#160;&#160;he&#160;purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning sloth and torpor &#160;he abides free from sloth and torpor &#160;percipient of light &#160;mindful and fully aware &#160;he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse &#160;he abides unagitated &#160;with a mind inwardly peaceful &#160;he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Abandoning doubt &#160;he abides having gone beyond doubt &#160;unperplexed about wholesome states &#160;he purifies his mind from doubt."</p>

  <p>"When these five hindrances are unabandoned in himself &#160;he sees them respectively as a debt &#160;a disease &#160;a prison &#160;slavery &#160;and a road across a desert. But when these five hindrances have been abandoned in himself &#160;he sees that as freedom from debt &#160;freedom from disease &#160;release from prison &#160;freedom from slavery &#160;and a land of safety. Considering thus &#160;he would be glad and full of joy."</p>

  <p>"Having abandoned these five hindrances &#160;imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom &#160;he enters upon and abides in the first jhāna &#160;the second jhāna &#160;the third jhāna &#160;the fourth jhāna."</p>

  <p>"When his concentrated mind is thus purified &#160;bright &#160;unblemished&#160;&#160;rid of imperfection &#160;malleable &#160;wieldy &#160;steady&#160;&#160;and attained to imperturbability &#160;he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives &#160;to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings &#160;and to knowledge of the destruction of the taints."</p>

  <p>"He understands as it actually is: This is suffering &#160;This is the origin of suffering &#160;This is the cessation of suffering &#160;This is the way of practice&#160;&#160;leading to the cessation of suffering &#160;These are the taints&#160;&#160;This is the origin of the taints &#160;This is the cessation of the taints &#160;This is the way of practice &#160;leading to the cessation of the taints."</p>

  <p>"When he knows and sees thus &#160;his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire &#160;from the taint of being &#160;and from the taint of ignorance. When liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated. He understands: 'Birth is exhausted &#160;the holy life is fulfilled &#160;what has to be done is done&#160;&#160;there is nothing else to do for the sake of liberation.'"</p>
