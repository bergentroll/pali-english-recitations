  <p style="text-align:center;">〈 Now let us recite the Gradual Training 〉</p>

  <p>"A householder or householder's son  or one born in some other clan hears the Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the Tathāgata. Possessing that faith he considers thus: 'Household life is crowded and dusty  life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy while living at home  to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure  as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard  put on the ochre robe  and go forth from home to homelessness.' On a later occasion  abandoning a small or large fortune  abandoning a small or large circle of relatives  he shaves off his hair and beard  puts on the ochre robe  and goes forth from home to homelessness."</p>

  <p>"Now is it possible Master Gotama  to describe a gradual training  gradual practice  and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Vinaya?"</p>

  <p>"It is possible to describe a gradual training  gradual practice  and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Vinaya. When the Tathāgata obtains a person to be tamed  he first disciplines him thus: 'Come bhikkhu be virtuous  dwell restrained with the restraint of the Pātimokkha  perfect in conduct and resort  and seeing danger in the slightest faults  train by undertaking the training rules.''</p>

  <div class="suttaref">
    <p>[MN 107]</p>
  </div>

  <p>"Having thus gone forth  and possessing the bhikkhus' training and way of life  abandoning the destruction of life  he abstains from destroying life  with rod and weapon laid aside  conscientious  merciful  he abides compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given  he abstains from taking what is not given  taking only what is given  expecting only what is given  by not stealing he abides in purity.</p>

  <p>Abandoning the household life  he observes the holy life  living apart  abstaining from the vulgar practice of sexual intercourse."</p>

  <p>"Abandoning false speech  he abstains from false speech  he speaks truth  adheres to truth  is trustworthy and reliable  one who is no deceiver of the world. Abandoning malicious speech  he abstains from malicious speech  he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here  in order to divide those<a id="en59" href="endnotes.xhtml#en59appendix"><sup>59</sup></a> people from these  nor does he repeat here what he has heard elsewhere  in order to divide these people from those  thus he is one who reunites those who are divided  a promoter of friendships  who enjoys unity  rejoices in unity  delights in unity  a speaker of words that promote unity. Abandoning harsh speech  he abstains from harsh speech  he speaks words that are gentle  pleasing to the ear  and loveable  that go to the heart  are courteous  desired by many and agreeable to many. Abandoning idle chatter  he abstains from idle chatter  he speaks at the right time  speaks what is fact  speaks on what is good  speaks on the Dhamma and Vinaya  at the right time  he speaks words that are worth recording  reasonable  moderate  and beneficial."</p>

  <p>"He abstains from harming seeds and plants. He practices eating one meal a day  abstaining from eating at night and outside the proper time. He abstains from dancing  singing  music and entertainments. He abstains from wearing garlands  smartening himself with scent  and embellishing himself with unguents. He abstains from high and luxurious sleeping places. He abstains from accepting gold and silver. He abstains from accepting raw grain. He abstains from accepting raw meat. He abstains from accepting women and girls. He abstains from accepting men and women slaves. He abstains from accepting goats and sheep. He abstains from accepting fowl and pigs. He abstains from accepting elephants  cattle  horses and mares. He abstains from accepting fields and land."</p>

  <p>"He abstains from running errands and messages. He abstains from buying and selling. He abstains from false weights  false metals  and false measures. He abstains from accepting bribes  deceiving  defrauding  and trickery. He abstains from wounding  murdering  binding  robbery  plunder and violence."</p>

  <p>"He becomes content with robes to protect his body  and almsfood to maintain his stomach  and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with him. Just as a bird  wherever it goes  flies with its wings as its only burden  so too the bhikkhu becomes content  with robes to protect his body  and almsfood to maintain his stomach  and wherever he goes  he sets out taking only these with him. Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue  he experiences within himself a bliss that is blameless."</p>

  <div class="suttaref">
    <p>[MN 51]</p>
  </div>

  <p>"Then the Tathāgata disciplines him further: 'Come bhikkhu  guard the doors of your sense faculties. On seeing a form with the eye  do not grasp at its signs and features. Since if you were to leave the eye faculty unguarded  evil unwholesome states of longing and grief might invade you  practice the way of its restraint  guard the eye faculty  undertake the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear. On smelling an odour with the nose. On tasting a flavour with the tongue. On touching a tangible with the body. On cognizing a mind-object with the mind  do not grasp at its signs and features. Since if you were to leave the mind faculty unguarded  evil unwholesome states of longing and grief might invade you  practice the way of its restraint  guard the mind faculty  undertake the restraint of the mind faculty.''</p>

  <p>"Come bhikkhu  be moderate in eating. Wisely reflecting I use almsfood  not for fun  not for pleasure  not for fattening  not for beautification  only for the maintenance and nourishment of this body  for keeping it healthy  for helping with the holy life  thinking thus: I will allay hunger without overeating  so that I may continue to live blamelessly and at ease."</p>

  <p>"Come bhikkhu  be devoted to wakefulness. During the day  while walking back and forth and sitting  purify your mind of obstructive states. In the first watch of the night  while walking back and forth and sitting  purify your mind of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night  you should lie down on the right side  in the lion's pose  with one foot overlapping the other  mindful and fully aware  after noting in your mind the time for rising. After rising in the third watch of the night  while walking back and forth and sitting  purify your mind of obstructive states."</p>

  <p>"Come bhikkhu  be possessed of mindfulness and full awareness. Act in full awareness when going forward and returning  act in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away  act in full awareness when flexing and extending your limbs  act in full awareness when wearing your robes  and carrying your outer robe and bowl  act in full awareness when eating  drinking  consuming food  and tasting  act in full awareness when defecating and urinating  act in full awareness when walking  standing  sitting  falling asleep  waking up<a id="en60" href="endnotes.xhtml#en60appendix"><sup>60</sup></a>  talking  and keeping silent."</p>

  <p>"Come bhikkhu  resort to a secluded resting place: a forest  the foot of a tree  a mountain  a ravine  a hillside cave  a charnel ground  a jungle thicket  an open space  a heap of straw."</p>

  <p>"After his meal on returning from almsround he sits down  having crossed his legs  sets his body erect  having established mindfulness in front of him. Abandoning longing<a id="en61" href="endnotes.xhtml#en61appendix"><sup>61</sup></a> for the world  he abides with a mind free from longing  he purifies his mind from longing. Abandoning ill will and hatred  he abides with a mind free from ill will  compassionate for the welfare of all living beings  he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning sloth and torpor  he abides free from sloth and torpor  percipient of light  mindful and fully aware  he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse  he abides unagitated  with a mind inwardly peaceful  he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Abandoning doubt  he abides having gone beyond doubt  unperplexed about wholesome states  he purifies his mind from doubt."</p>

  <p>"When these five hindrances are unabandoned in himself  he sees them respectively as a debt  a disease  a prison  slavery  and a road across a desert. But when these five hindrances have been abandoned in himself  he sees that as freedom from debt  freedom from disease  release from prison  freedom from slavery  and a land of safety. Considering thus  he would be glad and full of joy."</p>

  <p>"Having abandoned these five hindrances  imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom  he enters upon and abides in the first jhāna  the second jhāna  the third jhāna  the fourth jhāna."</p>

  <p>"When his concentrated mind is thus purified  bright  unblemished  rid of imperfection  malleable  wieldy  steady  and attained to imperturbability  he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives  to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings  and to knowledge of the destruction of the taints."</p>

  <p>"He understands as it actually is: This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the way of practice  leading to the cessation of suffering  These are the taints  This is the origin of the taints  This is the cessation of the taints  This is the way of practice  leading to the cessation of the taints."</p>

  <p>"When he knows and sees thus  his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire  from the taint of being  and from the taint of ignorance. When liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated. He understands: 'Birth is exhausted  the holy life is fulfilled  what has to be done is done  there is nothing else to do for the sake of liberation.'"</p>

  <p>"This is my instruction to those bhikkhus who are in higher training  whose minds have not yet attained the goal  who abide aspiring to the supreme security from bondage."</p>
