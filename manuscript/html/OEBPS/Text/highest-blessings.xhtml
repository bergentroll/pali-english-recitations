  <center>〈 Now let us recite the verses on the Highest Blessings<a href="endnotes.xhtml#en46"><sup>46</sup></a> 〉</center>

  <p>Thus have I heard that the Blessed One<br/> Was dwelling at Sāvatthī<a href="endnotes.xhtml#en47"><sup>47</sup></a><br/> Residing at the Jeta's Grove<br/> In Anāthapiṇḍika's Park</p>

  <p>Then in the dark of the night<br/> A radiant deva illuminated all Jeta's Grove<br/> She bowed down low before the Blessed One<br/> Then standing to one side she said:</p>

  <p>“Devas are concerned for happiness<br/> And ever long for peace<br/> The same is true for humankind<br/> What then are the highest blessings?”</p>

  <p>Avoiding those of foolish ways<br/> Associating with the wise<br/> And honouring those worthy of honour<br/> These are the highest blessings</p>

  <p>Living in places of suitable kinds<br/> With the fruits of past good deeds<br/> And guided by the rightful way<br/> These are the highest blessings</p>

  <p>Accomplished in learning and craftsman's skills<br/> With discipline highly trained<br/> And speech that is true and pleasant to hear<br/> These are the highest blessings</p>

  <p>Providing for mother and father's support<br/> And cherishing family<br/> And ways of work that harm no being<br/> These are the highest blessings</p>

  <p>Generosity and a righteous life<br/> Offering help to relatives and kin<br/> And acting in ways that leave no blame<br/> These are the highest blessings</p>

  <p>Steadfast in restraint and shunning evil ways<br/> Avoiding intoxicants that dull the mind<br/> And heedfulness in all things that arise<br/> These are the highest blessings</p>

  <p>Respectfulness and being of humble ways<br/> Contentment and gratitude<br/> And hearing the Dhamma frequently taught<br/> These are the highest blessings</p>

  <p>Patience and willingness to accept one's faults<br/> Seeing venerated seekers of the truth<br/> And sharing often the words of Dhamma<br/> These are the highest blessings</p>

  <p>Ardent and committed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#en48"><sup>48</sup></a> to the holy life<br/> Seeing for oneself the Noble Truths<br/> And the realization of Nibbāna<br/> These are the highest blessings</p>

  <p>Although in contact with the world<br/> Unshaken the mind remains<br/> Beyond all sorrow spotless secure<br/> These are the highest blessings</p>

  <p>They who live by following this path<br/> Know victory wherever they go<br/> And every place for them is safe<br/> These are the highest blessings</p>
