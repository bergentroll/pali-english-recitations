  <h2>The Discourse on Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma<a id="wheel-of-dhamma-full"></a></h2>

  <center>〈 Thus Have I Heard 〉</center>

  <p>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārāṇasī <span class="breathmark">'</span> in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five thus:</p>

  <p>Bhikkhus these two extremes should not be followed by one who has gone forth into homelessness. What two? The pursuit of sensual happiness in sensual pleasures <span class="breathmark">'</span> which is low <span class="breathmark">'</span> vulgar <span class="breathmark">'</span> the way of worldlings <span class="breathmark">'</span> ignoble <span class="breathmark">'</span> unbeneficial <span class="breathmark">'</span> and the pursuit of self-mortification <span class="breathmark">'</span> which is painful <span class="breathmark">'</span> ignoble <span class="breathmark">'</span> unbeneficial.</p>

  <p>Without veering towards either of these extremes <span class="breathmark">'</span> the Tathāgata has awakened to the middle way <span class="breathmark">'</span> which gives rise to vision <span class="breathmark">'</span> which gives rise to knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> which leads to peace <span class="breathmark">'</span> to direct knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> to enlightenment <span class="breathmark">'</span> to Nibbāna.</p>

  <p>And what <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> is the Middle Way awakened to by the Tathāgata which gives rise to vision <span class="breathmark">'</span> which gives rise to knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> which leads to peace <span class="breathmark">'</span> to direct knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> to enlightenment <span class="breathmark">'</span> to Nibbāna.</p>

  <p>It is this Noble Eightfold Path:</p>

  <p>That Is <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right View <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Intention <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Speech <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Action <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Livelihood <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Effort <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Mindfulness <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Concentration.</p>

  <p>This <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> is that middle way awakened to by the Tathāgata <span class="breathmark">'</span> which gives rise to vision <span class="breathmark">'</span> which gives rise to knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> which leads to peace <span class="breathmark">'</span> to direct knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> to enlightenment <span class="breathmark">'</span> to Nibbāna.</p>

  <p>Now this <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering <span class="breathmark">'</span> ageing is suffering <span class="breathmark">'</span> illness is suffering <span class="breathmark">'</span> death is suffering <span class="breathmark">'</span> union with what is displeasing is suffering <span class="breathmark">'</span> separation from what is pleasing is suffering <span class="breathmark">'</span> not to get what one wants is suffering <span class="breathmark">'</span> in brief <span class="breathmark">'</span> the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.</p>

  <p>Now this <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving which leads to renewed existence <span class="breathmark">'</span> accompanied by delight and lust <span class="breathmark">'</span> seeking delight here and there <span class="breathmark">'</span> that is <span class="breathmark">'</span> craving for sensual pleasures <span class="breathmark">'</span> craving for existence <span class="breathmark">'</span> craving for extermination.</p>

  <p>Now this <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving <span class="breathmark">'</span> the giving up and relinquishing of it <span class="breathmark">'</span> freedom from it <span class="breathmark">'</span> nonreliance on it.</p>

  <p>Now this <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: It is this Noble Eightfold Path;</p>

  <p>That Is <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right View <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Intention <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Speech <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Action <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Livelihood <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Effort <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Mindfulness <span class="breathmark">'</span> Right Concentration.</p>

  <p>This is the noble truth of suffering': thus <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> in regard to things unheard before <span class="breathmark">'</span> there arose in me vision <span class="breathmark">'</span> knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> wisdom <span class="breathmark">'</span> true knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> and light.</p>

  <p>This noble truth of suffering is to be fully understood': thus <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> in regard to things unheard before <span class="breathmark">'</span> there arose in me vision <span class="breathmark">'</span> knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> wisdom <span class="breathmark">'</span> true knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> and light.</p>

  <p>This noble truth of suffering has been fully understood': thus <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> in regard to things unheard before <span class="breathmark">'</span> there arose in me vision <span class="breathmark">'</span> knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> wisdom <span class="breathmark">'</span> true knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> and light.</p>

  <p>This noble truth of the origin of suffering is to be abandoned': thus <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> in regard to things unheard before <span class="breathmark">'</span> there arose in me vision <span class="breathmark">'</span> knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> wisdom <span class="breathmark">'</span> true knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> and light.</p>

  <p>This is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering': thus <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> in regard to things unheard before <span class="breathmark">'</span> there arose in me vision <span class="breathmark">'</span> knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> wisdom <span class="breathmark">'</span> true knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> and light.</p>

  <p>This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering is to be developed': thus <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> in regard to things unheard before <span class="breathmark">'</span> there arose in me vision <span class="breathmark">'</span> knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> wisdom <span class="breathmark">'</span> true knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> and light.</p>

  <p>This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has been developed': thus <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> in regard to things unheard before <span class="breathmark">'</span> there arose in me vision <span class="breathmark">'</span> knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> wisdom <span class="breathmark">'</span> true knowledge <span class="breathmark">'</span> and light.</p>

  <p>So long <span class="breathmark">'</span> bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> as my knowledge and vision of these Four Noble Truths as they really are in their three phases and twelve aspects was not thoroughly purified in this way <span class="breathmark">'</span> I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas <span class="breathmark">'</span> Māra <span class="breathmark">'</span> and Brahmā <span class="breathmark">'</span> in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins <span class="breathmark">'</span> its devas and humans.</p>

  <p>But when my knowledge and vision of these Four Noble Truths as they really are in their three phases and twelve aspects was thoroughly purified in this way <span class="breathmark">'</span> then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas <span class="breathmark">'</span> Māra <span class="breathmark">'</span> and Brahmā <span class="breathmark">'</span> in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins <span class="breathmark">'</span> its devas and humans.</p>

  <p>This is what the Blessed One said. Elated <span class="breathmark">'</span> the bhikkhus of the group of five delighted in the Blessed One's statement.</p>

  <p>And while this discourse was being spoken <span class="breathmark">'</span> there arose in the Venerable Kondañña the dust-free <span class="breathmark">'</span> stainless vision of the Dhamma:</p>

  <p>“Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.”</p>

  <p>And when the Wheel of the Dhamma had been set in motion by the Blessed One,&#160;the earth-dwelling devas raised a cry:</p>

  <p>“At Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana <span class="breathmark">'</span> this unsurpassed Wheel of the Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One <span class="breathmark">'</span> which cannot be stopped by any ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”</p>

  <p>Having heard the cry of the earth-dwelling devas <span class="breathmark">'</span> the devas of the realm of the Four Great Kings raised a cry...</p>

  <p>Having heard the cry of the devas of the realm of the Four Great Kings <span class="breathmark">'</span> the Tāvatiṁsa devas raised a cry...</p>

  <p>Having heard the cry of the Tāvatiṁsa devas <span class="breathmark">'</span> the Yāma devas raised a cry...</p>

  <p>Having heard the cry of the Yāma devas <span class="breathmark">'</span> the Tusita devas raised a cry...</p>

  <p>Having heard the cry of the Tusita devas <span class="breathmark">'</span> the Nimmānaratī devas raised a cry...</p>

  <p>Having heard the cry of the Nimmānaratī devas <span class="breathmark">'</span> the Paranimmitavasavattī devas raised a cry...</p>

  <p>Having heard the cry of the Paranimmitavasavattī devas <span class="breathmark">'</span> the devas of Brahmā's company raised a cry:</p>

  <p>“At Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana <span class="breathmark">'</span> this unsurpassed Wheel of the Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One <span class="breathmark">'</span> which cannot be stopped by any ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”</p>

  <p>Thus at that moment <span class="breathmark">'</span> at that instant <span class="breathmark">'</span> at that second <span class="breathmark">'</span> the cry spread as far as the brahmā world <span class="breathmark">'</span> and this ten thousandfold world system shook <span class="breathmark">'</span> quaked <span class="breathmark">'</span> and trembled <span class="breathmark">'</span> and an immeasurable glorious radiance appeared in the world surpassing the divine majesty of the devas.</p>

  <p>Then the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance:</p>

  <p>“Koṇḍañña has indeed understood! Koṇḍañña has indeed understood!”</p>

  <p>In this way the Venerable Koṇḍañña acquired the name “Aññā Koṇḍañña—Koṇḍañña Who Has Understood.”</p>
