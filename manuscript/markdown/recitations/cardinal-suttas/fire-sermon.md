On one occasion<a href="appendix/endnotes.html#en113" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>113</sup></a> the Blessed One was dwelling at Gayā <span class="breathmark">'</span> at Gayā's Head <span class="breathmark">'</span> together with a thousand bhikkhus. There he addressed the bhikkhus:

Bhikkhus all is burning!

And what bhikkhus is the all that is burning?

Burning with what?\
Burning with the fire of lust <span class="breathmark">'</span> with the fire of hate <span class="breathmark">'</span> with the fire of delusion.\
I say it is burning with birth <span class="breathmark">'</span> ageing and death <span class="breathmark">'</span> with sorrows <span class="breathmark">'</span> with lamentations <span class="breathmark">'</span> with pains <span class="breathmark">'</span> with displeasures <span class="breathmark">'</span> with despairs.

The ear is burning <span class="breathmark">'</span> sounds are burning <span class="breathmark">'</span> ear-consciousness is burning <span class="breathmark">'</span> ear-contact is burning <span class="breathmark">'</span> and what is felt as pleasant or painful <span class="breathmark">'</span> or neither-painful-nor-pleasant <span class="breathmark">'</span> that arises from ear-contact as its condition <span class="breathmark">'</span> that too is burning.\

〈 Bhikkhus when a noble disciple 〉

Who has heard the teaching sees thus <span class="breathmark">'</span> he becomes disenchanted with the eye <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with forms <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with eye-consciousness <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with eye-contact <span class="breathmark">'</span> and what is felt as pleasant or painful <span class="breathmark">'</span> or neither-painful-nor-pleasant <span class="breathmark">'</span> that arises from eye-contact as its condition <span class="breathmark">'</span> with that too he becomes disenchanted.

He becomes disenchanted with the ear <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with sounds <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with ear-consciousness <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with ear-contact <span class="breathmark">'</span> and what is felt as pleasant or painful <span class="breathmark">'</span> or neither-painful-nor-pleasant <span class="breathmark">'</span> that arises from ear-contact as its condition <span class="breathmark">'</span> with that too be becomes disenchanted.

He becomes disenchanted with the nose <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with odours <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with nose-consciousness <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with nose-contact <span class="breathmark">'</span> and what is felt as pleasant or painful <span class="breathmark">'</span> or neither-painful-nor-pleasant <span class="breathmark">'</span> that arises from nose-contact as its condition <span class="breathmark">'</span> with that too he becomes disenchanted.

He becomes disenchanted with the tongue <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with flavours <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with tongue-consciousness <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with tongue-contact <span class="breathmark">'</span> and what is felt as pleasant or painful <span class="breathmark">'</span> or neither-painful-nor-pleasant <span class="breathmark">'</span> that arises from tongue-contact as its condition <span class="breathmark">'</span> with that too he becomes disenchanted.

He becomes disenchanted with the body <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with tangibles <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with body-consciousness <span class="breathmark">'</span> becomes disenchanted with body-contact <span class="breathmark">'</span> and what is felt as pleasant or painful <span class="breathmark">'</span> or neither-painful-nor-pleasant <span class="breathmark">'</span> that arises from body-contact as its condition <span class="breathmark">'</span> with that too he becomes disenchanted.

When he is disenchanted passion fades away. With the fading of passion he is liberated. When liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated. He understands: “Birth is exhausted <span class="breathmark">'</span> the holy life is fulfilled <span class="breathmark">'</span> what has to be done is done <span class="breathmark">'</span> there is nothing else to do for the sake of liberation.”

That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were glad and they approved of his words. Now during this utterance <span class="breathmark">'</span> the hearts of those thousand bhikkhus <span class="breathmark">'</span> were liberated from the taints through the cessation of clinging.
