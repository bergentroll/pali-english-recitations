[Adāsi me akāsi me] – Ñāti-mittā sakhā ca me
Petānaṁ dakkhiṇaṁ dajjā – Pubbe katam'anussaraṁ

<div class="english">

> “He gave to me [gifts], he did [things] for me.
> They're my relatives, friends and pals.”
> To the deceased one should give offerings,
> Remembering what was done before.

</div>

Na hi ruṇṇaṁ vā soko vā – Yā v’aññā paridevanā
Na taṁ petānam'atthāya – Evaṁ tiṭṭhanti ñātayo

<div class="english">

> For neither weeping nor sorrow,
> Nor any form of lamentation
> Benefits the departed ones.
> Such is how the relatives remain.

</div>

Ayañ'ca kho dakkhinā dinnā – Saṅghamhi supatiṭṭhitā
Dīgharattaṁ hitāy’assa – Ṭhānaso upakappati

<div class="english">

> And this offering that has been given
> And firmly established in the Saṅgha,
> Would be for their long-term welfare
> And arrives there immediately.

</div>

So ñāti-dhammo ca ayaṁ nidassito – Petāna’pūjā ca katā uḷārā
Balañ'ca bhikkhūnam'anuppadinnaṁ – Tumhehi puññaṁ pasutaṁ anappakan’ti

<div class="english">

> And the duty of relatives has been shown,
> And lofty honouring of the departed done;
> Strength has also been given to the bhikkhus,
> And much merit accumulated by you all.

</div>
