suttaRef{[Dhs A]}

[Adāsi me akāsi me] – Ñāti-mittā sakhā ca me
Petānaṁ dakkhiṇaṁ dajjā – Pubbe katam-anussaraṁ

“He gave to me [gifts], he did [things] for me.
They're my relatives, friends and pals.”
To the deceased one should give offerings,
Remembering what was done before.

Na hi ruṇṇaṁ vā soko vā – Yā v’aññā paridevanā
Na taṁ petānam-atthāya – Evaṁ tiṭṭhanti ñātayo

For neither weeping nor sorrow,
Nor any form of lamentation
Benefits the departed ones.
Such is how the relatives remain.

Ayañ-ca kho dakkhinā dinnā – Saṅghamhi supatiṭṭhitā
Dīgharattaṁ hitāy’assa – Ṭhānaso upakappati

And this offering that has been given
And firmly established in the Saṅgha,
Would be for their long-term welfare
And arrives there immediately.

So ñāti-dhammo ca ayaṁ nidassito – Petāna’pūjā ca katā uḷārā
Balañ-ca bhikkhūnam-anuppadinnaṁ – Tumhehi puññaṁ pasutaṁ anappakan’ti

And the duty of relatives has been shown,
And lofty honouring of the departed done;
Strength has also been given to the bhikkhus,
And much merit accumulated by you all.

Their nature is to rise and cease; i
Having arisen things must cease;
Their stilling is true happiness.

[Sabbe sattā] maranti ca – Mariṁsu ca marissare
Tath’evāhaṁ marissāmi – N’atthi me ettha saṁsayo [3x]

[All living beings] are dying,
Have died, and will die.
In the same way, I will die,
I have no doubt about this.

[Aciraṁ vat’ayaṁ kāyo] – Paṭhaviṁ adhisessati
Chuḍḍho apeta-viññāṇo – Niratthaṁ va kaliṅgaraṁ [3x]

[All too soon, this body]
Will lie on the ground cast off,
Bereft of consciousness,
Like a useless scrap of wood.
