Kind, venerable sirs: having spread thoughts of good will,
Recite the protective chant with undistracted mind.
Those in the heavens of sensuality & form,
On peaks & mountain precipices, in palaces floating in the sky,
In islands, countries, & towns,
In groves of trees & thickets,
Around homesites & fields.
And the earth-devas, spirits, heavenly minstrels, & nāgas who are nearby,
In different waters and lands:
May they come & listen with approval as I recite the word of the excellent sage.
