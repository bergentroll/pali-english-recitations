> Kind, venerable sirs: having spread thoughts of good will,
> Recite the protective chant with undistracted mind.
> Those in the heavens of sensuality & form,
> On peaks & mountain precipices, in palaces floating in the sky,
> In islands, countries, & towns,
> In groves of trees & thickets,
> Around homesites & fields.
> And the earth-devas, spirits, heavenly minstrels, & nāgas who are nearby,
> In different waters and lands:
> May they come & listen with approval as I recite the word of the excellent sage.
