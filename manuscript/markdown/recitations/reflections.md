section{The Four Requisites}
paliTitle{Cattaro parrikhārā}

[Handa mayaṁ taṅkhaṇika-paccavekkhaṇa-pāṭhaṁ bhaṇāmase]

Paṭisaṅkhā yoniso cīvaraṁ paṭisevāmi
Yāvadeva sītassa paṭighātāya
Uṇhassa paṭighātāya
Ḍaṁsa-makasa-vātātapa-siriṁsapa-samphassānaṁ paṭighātāya
Yāvadeva hirikopina-paṭicchādanatthaṁ

Wisely reflecting  ̓  I use the robe
Only to ward off cold  ̓  to ward off heat  ̓  to ward off the touch of flies  ̓  mosquitoes wind burning and creeping things
Only for the sake of modesty

Paṭisaṅkhā yoniso piṇḍapātaṁ paṭisevāmi
Neva davāya na madāya na maṇḍanāya na vibhūsanāya
Yāvadeva imassa kāyassa ṭhitiyā yāpanāya
Vihiṁsūparatiyā brahmacariyānuggahāya
Iti purāṇañca vedanaṁ paṭihaṅkhāmi
Navañca vedanaṁ na uppādessāmi
Yātrā ca me bhavissati anavajjatā ca phāsuvihāro cā’ti

Wisely reflecting  ̓  I use almsfood
Not for fun  ̓  not for pleasure  ̓  not for fattening  ̓  not for beautification
Only for the maintenance and nourishment of this body
For keeping it healthy  ̓  for helping with the holy life
Thinking thus: “I will allay hunger without overeating
So that I may continue to live blamelessly and at ease”

Paṭisaṅkhā yoniso senāsanaṁ paṭisevāmi
Yāvadeva sītassa paṭighātāya
Uṇhassa paṭighātāya
Ḍaṁsa-makasa-vātātapa-siriṁsapa-samphassānaṁ paṭighātāya
Yāvadeva utuparissaya-vinodanaṁ paṭisallānārāmatthaṁ

Wisely reflecting  ̓  I use the lodging
Only to ward off cold  ̓  to ward off heat  ̓  to ward off the touch of flies  ̓  mosquitoes wind burning and creeping things
Only to remove the danger from weather  ̓  and for living in seclusion

Paṭisaṅkhā yoniso gilāna-paccaya-bhesajja-parikkhāraṁ paṭisevāmi
Yāvadeva uppannānaṁ veyyābādhikānaṁ vedanānaṁ paṭighātāya
Abyāpajjha-paramatāyā’ti

Wisely reflecting  ̓  I use supports for the sick and medicinal requisites
Only to ward off painful feelings that have arisen
For the maximum freedom from disease

suttaRef{[MN 2]}

section{The Repulsiveness of Food}
paliTitle{Āhāra-paṭikūla-paccavekkhaṇa-pāṭho}

[Handa mayaṁ āhāra-paṭikūla-paccavekkhaṇa-pāṭhaṁ bhaṇāmase]

Āhāre paṭikūlasaññāparicitena bhikkhave  ̓  bhikkhuno cetasā bahulaṁ viharato

When a bhikkhu often dwells with a mind
Accustomed to the perception of the repulsiveness of food

Rasataṇhāya cittaṁ patilīyati

His mind shrinks away from craving for tastes

Patikuṭati pativattati na sampasāriyati

Turns back from it
Rolls away from it
And is not drawn towards it

Upekkhā vā pāṭikulyatā vā saṇṭhāti

Either equanimity or disgust become settled in him

suttaRef{[AN 7.49]}

Sabbo panāyaṁ piṇḍa-pāto ajigucchanīyo

None of this almsfood is innately repulsive

Imaṁ pūti-kāyaṁ patvā

But touching this unclean body

Ativiya jigucchanīyo jāyati

It becomes disgusting indeed

suttaRef{[Trad]}

section{Universal Well-Being}
paliTitle{Mettā-pharaṇa}

[Handa mayaṁ mettāpharaṇaṁ karomase]

Ahaṁ sukhito homi
Niddukkho homi
Avero homi
Abyāpajjho homi
Anīgho homi
Sukhī attānaṁ pariharāmi
Sabbe sattā sukhitā hontu
Sabbe sattā averā hontu
Sabbe sattā abyāpajjhā hontu
Sabbe sattā anīghā hontu
Sabbe sattā sukhī attānaṁ pariharantu
Sabbe sattā sabbadukkhā pamuccantu
Sabbe sattā laddha-sampattito mā vigacchantu

Sabbe sattā kammassakā kammadāyādā kammayonī kammabandhū kammapaṭisaraṇā
Yaṁ kammaṁ karissanti
Kalyāṇaṁ vā pāpakaṁ vā
Tassa dāyādā bhavissanti

[Now let us recite the reflections on universal well-being]

May I abide in well-being
In freedom from affliction
In freedom from hostility
In freedom from ill-will
In freedom from anxiety
And may I maintain well-being in myself
May everyone abide in well-being
In freedom from hostility
In freedom from ill-will
In freedom from anxiety
And may they maintain well-being in themselves
May all beings be released from all suffering
And may they not be parted from the good fortune they have attainedi

All beings are the owners of their kamma
Heirs to their kamma
Born of their kamma
Related to their kamma
Abide supported by their kamma
Whatever kamma they shall do
Either skillful or harmful
Of such acts  ̓  they will be the heirs

suttaRef{[AN 3.65 & 5.57]}

[Now let us make the Four Boundless Qualities shine forth]

I will abide pervading one quarter with a heart imbued with loving-kindness
Likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
So above and below around and everywhere and to all as to myself
I will abide pervading the all-encompassing world with a heart imbued with loving-kindness
Abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill-will

I will abide pervading one quarter with a heart imbued with compassion
Likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
So above and below around and everywhere and to all as to myself

Abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill-will

I will abide pervading one quarter with a heart imbued with gladness
Likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
So above and below around and everywhere and to all as to myself
I will abide pervading the all-encompassing world with a heart imbued with gladness
Abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill-will

I will abide pervading one quarter with a heart imbued with equanimity
Likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
So above and below around and everywhere and to all as to myself
I will abide pervading the all-encompassing world with a heart imbued with equanimity
Abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill-will
