Āhāre paṭikūlasaññāparicitena bhikkhave \breathmark\ bhikkhuno cetasā bahulaṁ viharato



When a bhikkhu often dwells with a mind\
Accustomed to the perception of the repulsiveness of food


Rasataṇhāya cittaṁ patilīyati


His mind shrinks away from craving for tastes


Patikuṭati pativattati na sampasāriyati


Turns back from it\
Rolls away from it\
And is not drawn towards it


Upekkhā vā pāṭikulyatā vā saṇṭhāti


Either equanimity or disgust become settled in him


[AN 7.49]

Sabbo panāyaṁ piṇḍapāto ajigucchanīyo


None of this almsfood is innately repulsive


Imaṁ pūti-kāyaṁ patvā


But touching this unclean body


Ativiya jigucchanīyo jāyati


It becomes disgusting indeed


[Trad]
