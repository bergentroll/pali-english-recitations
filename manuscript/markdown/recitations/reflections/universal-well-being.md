Now let us recite the reflections on universal well-being
\end{leader-english}


May I abide in well-being\
In freedom from affliction\
In freedom from hostility\
In freedom from ill-will\
In freedom from anxiety\
And may I maintain well-being in myself\
May everyone abide in well-being\
In freedom from hostility\
In freedom from ill-will\
In freedom from anxiety\
And may they maintain well-being in themselves\
May all beings be released from all suffering\


And may they not be parted from the good fortune they have attained


All beings are the owners of their kamma
\hypertarget{endnote96-appendix}{\hyperlink{endnote96-body}{WPN: ``All beings are the owners of their action and inherit its results. Their future is born from such action, companion to such action, and its results will be their home. All actions with intention, be they skilful or harmful, of such acts they will be the heirs.'' For the sake of consistency with other chants within this chanting book, the original version was substituted with the one found in the ``Five subjects for frequent recollection'', and ``Ten subjects for frequent recollection by one who has gone forth''.}}}}}\makeatother\
Heirs to their kamma\
Born of their kamma\
Related to their kamma\
Abide supported by their kamma\
Whatever kamma they shall do\
Either skillful or harmful\
Of such acts \breathmark\ they will be the heirs\
