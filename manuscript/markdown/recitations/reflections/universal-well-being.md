\begin{english-verses}
  May I abide in well-being\\
  In freedom from affliction\\
  In freedom from hostility\\
  In freedom from ill-will\\
  In freedom from anxiety\\
  And may I maintain well-being in myself\\
  May everyone abide in well-being\\
  In freedom from hostility\\
  In freedom from ill-will\\
  In freedom from anxiety\\
  And may they maintain well-being in themselves\\
  May all beings be released from all suffering\\
