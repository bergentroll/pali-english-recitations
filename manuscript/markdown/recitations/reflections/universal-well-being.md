Ahaṁ sukhito homi\
Niddukkho homi\
Avero homi\
Abyāpajjho homi\
Anīgho homi\
Sukhī attānaṁ pariharāmi\
Sabbe sattā sukhitā hontu\
Sabbe sattā averā hontu\
Sabbe sattā abyāpajjhā hontu\
Sabbe sattā anīghā hontu\
Sabbe sattā sukhī attānaṁ pariharantu\
Sabbe sattā sabbadukkhā pamuccantu\
Sabbe sattā laddha-sampattito mā vigacchantu\

Sabbe sattā kammassakā kammadāyādā kammayonī kammabandhū kammapaṭisaraṇā\
Yaṁ kammaṁ karissanti\
Kalyāṇaṁ vā pāpakaṁ vā\
Tassa dāyādā bhavissanti
