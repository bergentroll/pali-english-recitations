Taṁ kissa hetu

For what reason?

Tathārūpānaṁ bhikkhave bhikkhūnaṁ dhammaṁ sutvā

Because when one has heard the Dhamma from such bhikkhus

Dvayena vūpakāsena vūpakaṭṭho viharati

One dwells withdrawn by way of two kinds of withdrawal

Kāyavūpakāsena ca cittavūpakāsena ca

Withdrawal of body and withdrawal of mind

So tathā vūpakaṭṭho viharanto

Dwelling thus withdrawn

Taṁ dhammaṁ anussarati anuvitakketi

One recollects that Dhamma and thinks it over

So tathā sato viharanto

Dwelling thus mindfully

Taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinati

One discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom

Pavicarati parivīmaṁsam-āpajjati

Examines it  ̓  makes an investigation of it

Tassa taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinato

For one who discriminates that Dhamma with wisdom

Pavicarato parivīmaṁsam-āpajjato

Examines it  ̓  makes an investigation of it

Āraddhaṁ hoti vīriyaṁ asallīnaṁ

One’s energy is aroused without slackening

Āraddhavīriyassa uppajjati pīti nirāmisā

For one who is energetic
Spiritual rapture arises

Pītimanassa kāyopi passambhati

For one whose mind is uplifted by rapture
The body becomes tranquil

Cittampi passambhati

And the mind becomes tranquil

Passaddhakāyassa sukhino

For one whose body is tranquil and who is happy

Cittaṁ samādhiyati

The mind becomes concentrated

So tathāsamāhitaṁ cittaṁ sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti

One closely looks on with equanimity
At the mind thus concentrated

To arouse his energy thus

Sarīre upasussatu maṁsa-lohitaṁ

And let the flesh and blood in this body wither away

Na taṁ apāpuṇitvā
Vīriyassa saṇṭhānaṁ bhavissatī’ti

By manly effort
Has not been attained
Let not my efforts stand still”
