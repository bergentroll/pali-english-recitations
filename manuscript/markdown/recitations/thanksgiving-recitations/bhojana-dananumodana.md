[Yo yassa bhojanaṁ deti]
So tassa deti pañca'pi
Āyuṁ balaṁ sukhaṁ vaṇṇaṁ
Paṭibhānañ'ca pañcamaṁi
Āyu-do bala-do dhīro
Vaṇṇa-do paṭibhāṇa-do
Sukhassa dātā medhāvī
Sukhaṁ so adhigacchati
Āyuṁ datvā balaṁ vaṇṇaṁ
Sukhañ'ca paṭibhāna-kaṁii
Dīgh’āyu yasavā hoti
Yattha yatth'ūpapajjati
Abhivādanasīlissa
Niccaṁ vuḍḍh'āpacāyino
Cattāro dhammā vaḍḍhanti
Āyu vaṇṇo sukhaṁ balaṁ
Padakkhiṇaṁ kāyakammaṁ
Vācākammaṁ padakkhiṇaṁ
Padakkhiṇaṁ manokammaṁ
Paṇīdhi te padakkhiṇe
Padakkhiṇāni katvāna
Labhant'atthe padakkhiṇe
Te atthaladdhā sukhitā
Virūḷhā Buddhasāsane
Arogā sukhitā hotha
Saha sabbehi ñātibhī
