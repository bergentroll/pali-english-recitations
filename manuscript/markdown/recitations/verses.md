section{The Highest Blessings}
paliTitle{Maṅgala-sutta}

> [Now let us recite the verses on the Highest Blessings]

Thus have I heard that the Blessed One
Was dwelling at Sāvatthī
Residing at the Jeta’s Grove
In Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park

Then in the dark of the night
A radiant deva illuminated all Jeta’s Grove
She bowed down low before the Blessed One
Then standing to one side she said:

“Devas are concerned for happiness
And ever long for peace
The same is true for humankind
What then are the highest blessings?”

Avoiding those of foolish ways
Associating with the wise
And honouring those worthy of honour
These are the highest blessings

Living in places of suitable kinds
With the fruits of past good deeds
And guided by the rightful way
These are the highest blessings

Accomplished in learning and craftsman’s skills
With discipline highly trained
And speech that is true and pleasant to hear
These are the highest blessings

Providing for mother and father’s support
And cherishing family
And ways of work that harm no being
These are the highest blessings

Generosity and a righteous life
Offering help to relatives and kin
And acting in ways that leave no blame
These are the highest blessings

Steadfast in restraint and shunning evil ways
Avoiding intoxicants that dull the mind
And heedfulness in all things that arise
These are the highest blessings

Respectfulness and being of humble ways
Contentment and gratitude
And hearing the Dhamma frequently taught
These are the highest blessings

Patience and willingness to accept one’s faults
Seeing venerated seekers of the truth
And sharing often the words of Dhamma
These are the highest blessings

Ardent and committedii to the holy life
Seeing for oneself the Noble Truths
And the realization of Nibbāna
These are the highest blessings

Although in contact with the world
Unshaken the mind remains
Beyond all sorrow spotless secure
These are the highest blessings

They who live by following this path
Know victory wherever they go
And every place for them is safe
These are the highest blessings

This is what should be done
By one who is skilled in goodness
And who knows the path of peace

Straightforward and gentle in speech
Humble and not conceited
Contented and easily satisfied
Unburdened with duties  ̓  and frugal in their ways
Peaceful and calm and wise and skillful
Not proud and demanding in nature
Let them not do the slightest thing
That the wise would later reprove
Wishing in gladness and in safety
May all beings be at ease
Whatever living beings there may be
Whether they are weak or strong  ̓  omitting none
The great or the mighty  ̓  medium short or small
The seen and the unseen
Those living near and far away
Those born and to be born
May all beings be at ease
Let none deceive another
Or despise any being in any state
Let none through anger or ill-will
Wish harm upon another
Justi as a mother protects with her life
Her child her only child
So with a boundless heart
Should one cherish all living beings
Radiating kindness  ̓  over the entire world
Spreading upwards to the skies
And downwards to the depths
Outwards and unbounded
Freed from hatred and ill-will
Whether standing or walking
Seated or lying down free from drowsiness
One should sustain this recollection
This is said to be the sublime abiding
By not holding wrong views
The pure-hearted one having clarity of vision
Being freed from all sense-desires
Is not born again into this world
