Thus have I heard that the Blessed One\
Was dwelling at Sāvatthī<a href="appendix/endnotes.html#en47" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>47</sup></a>\
Residing at the Jeta's Grove\
In Anāthapiṇḍika's Park

Then in the dark of the night\
A radiant deva illuminated all Jeta's Grove\
She bowed down low before the Blessed One\
Then standing to one side she said:

“Devas are concerned for happiness\
And ever long for peace\
The same is true for humankind\
What then are the highest blessings?”

Avoiding those of foolish ways\
Associating with the wise\
And honouring those worthy of honour\
These are the highest blessings

Living in places of suitable kinds\
With the fruits of past good deeds\
And guided by the rightful way\
These are the highest blessings

Accomplished in learning and craftsman's skills\
With discipline highly trained\
And speech that is true and pleasant to hear\
These are the highest blessings

Providing for mother and father's support\
And cherishing family\
And ways of work that harm no being\
These are the highest blessings

Generosity and a righteous life\
Offering help to relatives and kin\
And acting in ways that leave no blame\
These are the highest blessings

Steadfast in restraint and shunning evil ways\
Avoiding intoxicants that dull the mind\
And heedfulness in all things that arise\
These are the highest blessings

Respectfulness and being of humble ways\
Contentment and gratitude\
And hearing the Dhamma frequently taught\
These are the highest blessings

Patience and willingness to accept one's faults\
Seeing venerated seekers of the truth\
And sharing often the words of Dhamma\
These are the highest blessings

Ardent and committed<a href="appendix/endnotes.html#en48" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>48</sup></a> to the holy life\
Seeing for oneself the Noble Truths\
And the realization of Nibbāna\
These are the highest blessings

Although in contact with the world\
Unshaken the mind remains\
Beyond all sorrow spotless secure\
These are the highest blessings

They who live by following this path\
Know victory wherever they go\
And every place for them is safe\
These are the highest blessings
