〈 Now let us recite the Buddha’s words on loving-kindness]
</center>

This is what should be done\
By one who is skilled in goodness\
And who knows the path of peace\
Let them be able and upright\
Straightforward and gentle in speech\
Humble and not conceited\
Contented and easily satisfied\
Unburdened with duties  ̓  and frugal in their ways\
Peaceful and calm and wise and skillful\
Not proud and demanding in nature\
Let them not do the slightest thing\
That the wise would later reprove\
Wishing in gladness and in safety\
May all beings be at ease\
Whatever living beings there may be\
Whether they are weak or strong  ̓  omitting none\
The great or the mighty  ̓  medium short or small\
The seen and the unseen\
Those living near and far away\
Those born and to be born\
May all beings be at ease\
Let none deceive another\
Or despise any being in any state\
Let none through anger or ill-will\
Wish harm upon another\
Justi as a mother protects with her life\
Her child her only child\
So with a boundless heart\
Should one cherish all living beings\
Radiating kindness  ̓  over the entire world\
Spreading upwards to the skies\
And downwards to the depths\
Outwards and unbounded\
Freed from hatred and ill-will\
Whether standing or walking\
Seated or lying down free from drowsiness\
One should sustain this recollection\
This is said to be the sublime abiding\
By not holding wrong views\
The pure-hearted one having clarity of vision\
Being freed from all sense-desires\
Is not born again into this world

[Snp 1.8]
