<em>"In whatever way a bhikkhu recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhamma. As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated."</em><br></br>
<em>(AN 5.25)</em>

# Purpose and Benefits of Dhamma Recitation<a id="purpose-and-benefits"></a>

## Historical Background

After finding the path to Nibbāna and some initial hesitation, the Buddha eventually decided to teach the Dhamma (MN 26). His first disciples were a group of five monks, and with the awakening of one of them, Ven. Kondañña, the wheel of Dhamma was set in motion (SN 56.11). While these first disciples were taught exclusively by the Buddha himself, soon afterwards more monks reached the final goal. Subsequently, the Buddha sent out the first sixty arahants to teach the Dhamma (SN 4.5, Vin I 20).\

During that period of ancient India, religious texts were not commonly written down. Even for ordinary education purposes, much of learning happened through memorization. Writing was known, but not used for religious texts, which were considered too sacred to be put into writing; instead they were meant to live in the minds and hearts of those who saw their value, and made the effort to memorize them. In particular, the Brahmins were known for their proficiency in committing their corpus of sacred texts (Vedas) to memory and maintaining them with astonishing accuracy. Part of their skill was because memorization started from a young age. Likewise, also among Buddhist literature we can discover clear traces of standardization and mnemonic tools, meant to aim at precision and ease of memorization. In particular, the use of recurring stock phrases makes it easier to commit a large corpus of texts to memory (Anālayo, 2019). There is not much known about the specific teachings shared with their audience by the first arahants who went out to teach the Dhamma. But it is fair to assume that they took some teachings with them that were quick and easy to memorize. Let us also keep in mind that the Buddha’s disciples were not trained in memorization from childhood, but they came from all walks of life – young, old, educated, uneducated etc. Only when the Saṅgha had grown in size, monks who specialized in recitation travelled all across India and shared the Buddha’s teachings with those eager to hear them (Analayo, 2007).\

A passage that illustrates the Buddha’s own appreciation of recitation, stems from a conversation he had with a monk who had gone forth just recently. Without warning, the Buddha asked him to recite the Dhamma. The newly ordained monk recited the Aṭṭhakavagga of Sutta Nipāta (Ud 5.6). The Buddha was pleased and complimented the monk on his skills in remembering, keeping in mind, articulating, and enunciating of the texts. This highlights the Buddha’s emphasis that recitation of the Dhamma was meant to be taken seriously by his ordained disciples.\

## The Workings of Memory

Contrary to our intuition, memory doesn’t function like a scanner or copying machine that takes a snapshot of a text or event, and saves it for later. Instead, anecdotal memory works in a relational manner. The brain links new information that comes in through any of the 6 senses to concepts based on memories from the past. We understand new things in the light of and from the perspective of, things we already know. Likewise, we “remember” old things through the filters and biases of the present moment. “It is so natural for us to draw inferences that we are often unaware that we are doing so” (Eysenck, 1992/2005). This interplay between past and present gives our memory great potential due to its seemingly unlimited storage capacity (the Buddha recollected past lifetimes from memory, counting back many eons of world-dissolution and evolution). At the same time the interplay between past and future also makes memory inherently unreliable. The importance of memorization becomes clear. When texts are memorized literally, personal interpretation, biases, and coloring by past experiences and present circumstances have less opportunity to distort the information. Accuracy increases further if one checks the memorized text from time to time against its original, either by looking it up in a book, or by reciting it together with others. In this way, differences become apparent straight away.\

## Benefits for Dhamma Practice

In the discourses the Buddha is often depicted taking up the topic of recitation when explaining to monks the proper way to learn the teachings, and make these teachings the vessel within which their own wisdom can grow.\

> “He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—such teachings as these he has learned much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, mentally investigated, and penetrated well by view. This is the fifth cause and condition that leads to obtaining the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life.” (AN 8.2)\

In our current age of easy access to Dhamma books and multimedia, it is tempting to conclude that it is now not necessary anymore to memorize large bodies of texts for the sake of transmission, and that we are blessed with being able to read any of the texts at any time, from the comfort of our kuṭis or living rooms. And blessed we are. Nonetheless, even today recitation has benefits that surpass a regular silent reading, or even reading out loud. As seen in the earlier quote from AN 8.2, the Buddha doesn’t only speak about reciting the texts verbally, but also about retaining them in mind and investigating them mentally. This is where the benefits of recitation differ considerably from a more casual reading, or even from chanting with the help of a chanting book. By means of committing a text to memory, it lives much deeper within our minds and hearts, and we can reflect on it whenever and wherever. Dhamma that has been well-memorized, is always with us. The Buddha’s teachings become accessible in the very moment we need them, without having to resort to a book or an e-reader.\

Since right view is the first of eight path factors, it is of great importance for progress on the path to keep the Buddha’s teachings in mind, so that they can shape our views and perspectives; keeping them in memory in such a way that one can recognize their relevance whenever a situation in life occurs when they naturally manifest, or when they are most necessary to intentionally recall. Recollecting the Dhamma can be a source of joy, leading to rapture, tranquility, and concentration (AN 5.26); factors that can lead to a pleasant abiding here and now. It can also help to abandon drowsiness (AN 7.61), as well as speed up recovery from illness (AN 46.16), or to achieve a stage of awakening even on the deathbed (AN 6.56). In fact, reciting the Dhamma is one of the occasions that can even bring about the attainment of final liberation (AN 5.26).\

Though the bhikkhu Phagguṇa’s mind had not yet been liberated from the five lower fetters, when he heard that discourse on the Dhamma, his mind was liberated from them… There are, Ānanda, these six benefits of listening to the Dhamma at the proper time and of examining the meaning at the proper time. What six?\

> ...At the time of his death he does not get to see the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata, but he ponders, examines, and mentally inspects the Dhamma as he has heard it and learned it. As he does so, his mind is liberated in the unsurpassed extinction of the acquisitions. This is the sixth benefit of examining the meaning at the proper time. (AN 6.56)

> In whatever way the bhikkhu recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it and learned it, in just that way, in relation to that Dhamma, he experiences inspiration in the meaning and inspiration in the Dhamma. As he does so, joy arises in him. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is the third basis of liberation, by means of which, if a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are utterly destroyed, and he reaches the as-yet-unreached unsurpassed security from bondage. (AN 5.26)\

## Benefits for Rebirth

The depth to which a mere reading of a text penetrates the mind is incomparable to the depth of penetration that can be reached by memorization. AN 4.191 depicts monks who have memorized the Dhamma, and are subsequently reborn in circumstances with little to no exposure to the Dhamma. The sutta explains that not only in the current lifetime, but also in lifetimes ahead, the Dhamma that was previously memorized will be accessible and has a chance of being re-cognized or recollected even in a future existence e.g. as a deva. With the support of sufficient samādhi, not only can the Dhamma be recollected, but even one’s past lives:\

> “Bhikkhus, ...there are things to be realized by memory… And what are the things to be realized by memory? One’s past abodes are to be realized by memory. “ (AN 4.189)\

## Benefits for Communal Life

Besides being of benefit to one’s own Dhamma practice, and the benefits during future lifetimes, reciting the Dhamma can also have a beneficial impact on communal life. Accounts of the Buddhist councils (saṅgīti; lit. recitations) show that in all these important events of Buddhist history when the extended Saṅgha family came together, the DhammaVinaya was recited together, as a means to remain aligned with the teachings and to foster harmony. Another feature of monastic communities, is the fortnightly recitation of the Pātimokkha, the rules for monks and nuns, in which even solitary forest dwellers, including Arahants, were encouraged by the Buddha to participate, as they make their way to the nearest monastery in the vicinity (Mv.II.5.5). Recitation of texts together, not only strengthens a common commitment to the DhammaVinaya, but in a more practical way, it also enables monastics to chant in sync and unison when reciting together with their spiritual companions. This not only increases clarity and understanding, but also makes for a more homogenous listening experience at a ceremony, e.g. a dāna or bereavement service conducted by monastics. Furthermore, the coming together frequently to recite the Buddha’s teachings, creates a bond among Saṅgha members and leads to their growth. This would not be so if everyone recites the Dhamma on his own.\

> And what, bhikkhus, are the seven principles of non-decline? (1) “As long as the bhikkhus assemble often and hold frequent assemblies, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline. (2) “As long as the bhikkhus assemble in harmony, adjourn in harmony, and conduct the affairs of the Saṅgha in harmony, only growth is to be expected for them, not decline. (AN 7.23)\

## Recitation Among Monastics

While it is not uncommon in our current time and age that teachers share the Dhamma without any reference to the Buddha or his teachings, in the Buddha’s time the teachings were passed on from teacher to disciple by means of recitation. The Vinaya texts explain that “if the preceptor wants one to recite [C: memorize passages of Dhamma or Vinaya], one should recite. If he wants to interrogate one [C: on the meaning of the passages], one should answer his interrogation." (Cv.VIII.12.2-11)\

BMC I mentions that the Vibhaṅga to Pācittiya 4 lists four ways in which a person might be trained to be a reciter of a text:
1. The teacher and student recite in unison, i.e. beginning together and ending together.
2. The teacher begins a line, the student joins in, and they end together.
3. The teacher recites the beginning syllable of a line together with the student, who then completes it alone.
4. The teacher recites one line, and the student recites the next line alone.

In order for a monk to be free from dependence (nissaya) on a teacher, “he must be learned and intelligent, knowing both Pāṭimokkhas … and must have been ordained as a bhikkhu for at least five years” (Mv.I.53.5-13).

The Commentary says that a learned bhikkhu must have memorized:
• Both Pātimokkhas (for the bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs).
• The Four Bhāṇavāras — a set of auspicious chants that are still regularly memorized in Sri Lanka as the Mahā-pirit poṭha.
• A discourse that is helpful as a guide for sermon-giving.
• Three kinds of anumodanā (rejoicing in the merit of others) chants: for meals; for auspicious merit-making ceremonies, such as blessing a house; and for non-auspicious ceremonies, i.e. any relating to a death.

Lastly, when monastics from other sects wanted to become monks in the Buddha’s dispensation, they typically had to undergo a four-month probation period. However, “a probationer fails in his probation and is not to be accepted … if he does not have a keen desire for recitation.” (Mv.I.38.5-10)\

Once again, we can see the immense emphasis that was placed on memorization and recitation, starting already during the Buddha’s own ministry, and having continued all the way to the 21st century, where we can still find monks who are able to memorize the entirety of the Tipiṭaka.\

## What to Recite

While recitation and memorization of the Dhamma yields several benefits, and one may be committed to dedicate some amount of time to this worthwhile endeavor, one important task remains. Given the limited amount of texts one may be able to memorize and maintain in memory, the task is: the selection of texts for recitation and memorization, there being such a vast amount of teachings that the Buddha left behind. What is essential - what is secondary? Once again, we are in the fortunate situation that the Buddha himself gave guidance in what he regarded as the core teachings. In MN 104 the Buddha points to a set of 37 teachings, commonly known as the “Wings of Awakening” (bodhipakkhiyā dhammā). Included in these 37 Dhammas are the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right strivings, the four bases of spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of awakening, and the noble eightfold path. (DN 16). Other teachings that are commonly held in high esteem are the Discourse on Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma (Dhammacakkappavattanasutta), the Gradual Training, and The Dhamma in Brief. All of these are teachings that can help the earnest practitioner to gain an overview of the Dhamma and one’s path to liberation. Practicing accordingly, further recollection and recitation of such teachings also helps to correctly assess one’s own progress on the path.\

Besides these general teachings, the Buddha also went into great depth in explaining the most profound doctrines, some of which are related to the conceptual framework surrounding the practice, while others are directly related to formal meditation. Early sermons that stand out in this context are the Discourse on the Characteristics of Not-Self (Anatta-lakkhaṇa Sutta), the Fire Sermon (Āditta-Pariyāya Sutta), the Buddha’s First and Final Words, Mindfulness of Breathing, and Dependent Origination. All of these are profound, deep teachings that highlight key aspects of the path to awakening. These are teachings that are good to memorize and recite again and again (AN 10.48), allowing their deep meaning to gradually seep into our hearts.\

From these profound teachings we can take a step back to the practical, day-to-day perceptions that the Buddha specifically recommended to be frequently reflected upon. In this category we find the 5 and 10 Subjects for Frequent Recollection, also the Reflections on The Four Requisites, and a separate reflection on The Repulsiveness of Food. Recollection of Impermanence, The 3 Characteristics, and The Thirty-Two Body Parts are also frequently mentioned in the discourses. Perceptions that are closely related to the 2nd path factor of the noble eightfold path, i.e. right thought (sammā saṇkappa), are the Mettasutta and The Divine Abidings. Perceptions that arouse the four Brahmavihāras can seamlessly lead the practitioner towards the 8th path factor, sammā samādhi. At times when energy is lacking, however, chants that inspire, motivate, or arouse urgency, can be used to heat up and revitalize the practice. This is where Striving According to the Dhamma, The Burdens, Respect for the Dhamma, and the Miscellaneous Verses can come to the rescue.\

Lastly, this Recitation Book also includes passages that illuminate how to establish good relations among fellow practitioners, such as the Principles of Cordiality, Principles of Non-Decline, and The Four Great References. Also included are chants that monks commonly perform as services to the laity, such as Anumodanā, Sharing of Merits, and Funeral Chants.\

To summarize, memorization of the Dhamma and group recitation fulfill a variety of different purposes and benefits, ranging all the way from the mundane aspects such as the ability to recite in unison, the fostering of communal harmony, all the way to the attainment of final liberation.\

** The Highest Blessings

## The Highest Blessings<a id="highest-blessings"></a>
Maṅgala-sutta

> [Now let us recite the verses on the Highest Blessings]

Thus have I heard that the Blessed One
Was dwelling at Sāvatthī
Residing at the Jeta’s Grove
In Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park

Then in the dark of the night
A radiant deva illuminated all Jeta’s Grove
She bowed down low before the Blessed One
Then standing to one side she said:

“Devas are concerned for happiness
And ever long for peace
The same is true for humankind
What then are the highest blessings?”

Avoiding those of foolish ways
Associating with the wise
And honouring those worthy of honour
These are the highest blessings

Living in places of suitable kinds
With the fruits of past good deeds
And guided by the rightful way
These are the highest blessings

Accomplished in learning and craftsman’s skills
With discipline highly trained
And speech that is true and pleasant to hear
These are the highest blessings

Providing for mother and father’s support
And cherishing family
And ways of work that harm no being
These are the highest blessings

Generosity and a righteous life
Offering help to relatives and kin
And acting in ways that leave no blame
These are the highest blessings

Steadfast in restraint and shunning evil ways
Avoiding intoxicants that dull the mind
And heedfulness in all things that arise
These are the highest blessings

Respectfulness and being of humble ways
Contentment and gratitude
And hearing the Dhamma frequently taught
These are the highest blessings

Patience and willingness to accept one’s faults
Seeing venerated seekers of the truth
And sharing often the words of Dhamma
These are the highest blessings

Ardent and committedii to the holy life
Seeing for oneself the Noble Truths
And the realization of Nibbāna
These are the highest blessings

Although in contact with the world
Unshaken the mind remains
Beyond all sorrow spotless secure
These are the highest blessings

They who live by following this path
Know victory wherever they go
And every place for them is safe
These are the highest blessings

## The Buddha's Words on Loving-Kindness<a id="words-on-loving-kindness"></a>
Karaṇīya-metta-sutta

> [Now let us recite the Buddha’s words on loving-kindness]

This is what should be done
By one who is skilled in goodness
And who knows the path of peace
Let them be able and upright
Straightforward and gentle in speech
Humble and not conceited
Contented and easily satisfied
Unburdened with duties  ̓  and frugal in their ways
Peaceful and calm and wise and skillful
Not proud and demanding in nature
Let them not do the slightest thing
That the wise would later reprove
Wishing in gladness and in safety
May all beings be at ease
Whatever living beings there may be
Whether they are weak or strong  ̓  omitting none
The great or the mighty  ̓  medium short or small
The seen and the unseen
Those living near and far away
Those born and to be born
May all beings be at ease
Let none deceive another
Or despise any being in any state
Let none through anger or ill-will
Wish harm upon another
Justi as a mother protects with her life
Her child her only child
So with a boundless heart
Should one cherish all living beings
Radiating kindness  ̓  over the entire world
Spreading upwards to the skies
And downwards to the depths
Outwards and unbounded
Freed from hatred and ill-will
Whether standing or walking
Seated or lying down free from drowsiness
One should sustain this recollection
This is said to be the sublime abiding
By not holding wrong views
The pure-hearted one having clarity of vision
Being freed from all sense-desires
Is not born again into this world

## The Discourse on Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma<a id="wheel-of-dhamma-full"></a>

[Thus have I heard]

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārāṇasī  ̓  in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five thus:

Bhikkhus these two extremes should not be followed by one who has gone forth into homelessness. What two? The pursuit of sensual happiness in sensual pleasures  ̓  which is low  ̓  vulgar  ̓  the way of worldlings  ̓  ignoble  ̓  unbeneficial  ̓  and the pursuit of self-mortification  ̓  which is painful  ̓  ignoble  ̓  unbeneficial.

Without veering towards either of these extremes  ̓  the Tathāgata has awakened to the middle way  ̓  which gives rise to vision  ̓  which gives rise to knowledge  ̓  which leads to peace  ̓  to direct knowledge  ̓  to enlightenment  ̓  to Nibbāna.

And what  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  is the Middle Way awakened to by the Tathāgata which gives rise to vision  ̓  which gives rise to knowledge  ̓  which leads to peace  ̓  to direct knowledge  ̓  to enlightenment  ̓  to Nibbāna.

It is this Noble Eightfold Path:

That Is  ̓  Right View  ̓  Right Intention  ̓  Right Speech  ̓  Right Action  ̓  Right Livelihood  ̓  Right Effort  ̓  Right Mindfulness  ̓  Right Concentration.

This  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  is that middle way awakened to by the Tathāgata  ̓  which gives rise to vision  ̓  which gives rise to knowledge  ̓  which leads to peace  ̓  to direct knowledge  ̓  to enlightenment  ̓  to Nibbāna.

Now this  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering  ̓  ageing is suffering  ̓  illness is suffering  ̓  death is suffering  ̓  union with what is displeasing is suffering  ̓  separation from what is pleasing is suffering  ̓  not to get what one wants is suffering  ̓  in brief  ̓  the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.

Now this  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving which leads to renewed existence  ̓  accompanied by delight and lust  ̓  seeking delight here and there  ̓  that is  ̓  craving for sensual pleasures  ̓  craving for existence  ̓  craving for extermination.

Now this  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving  ̓  the giving up and relinquishing of it  ̓  freedom from it  ̓  nonreliance on it.

Now this  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: It is this Noble Eightfold Path;

That Is  ̓  Right View  ̓  Right Intention  ̓  Right Speech  ̓  Right Action  ̓  Right Livelihood  ̓  Right Effort  ̓  Right Mindfulness  ̓  Right Concentration.

This is the noble truth of suffering’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

This noble truth of suffering is to be fully understood’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

This noble truth of suffering has been fully understood’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

This noble truth of the origin of suffering is to be abandoned’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

This noble truth of the origin of suffering has been abandoned’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

This noble truth of the cessation of suffering is to be realized’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

This is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering is to be developed’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has been developed’: thus  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  in regard to things unheard before  ̓  there arose in me vision  ̓  knowledge  ̓  wisdom  ̓  true knowledge  ̓  and light.

So long  ̓  bhikkhus  ̓  as my knowledge and vision of these Four Noble Truths as they really are in their three phases and twelve aspects was not thoroughly purified in this way  ̓  I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas  ̓  Māra  ̓  and Brahmā  ̓  in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins  ̓  its devas and humans.

But when my knowledge and vision of these Four Noble Truths as they really are in their three phases and twelve aspects was thoroughly purified in this way  ̓  then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas  ̓  Māra  ̓  and Brahmā  ̓  in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins  ̓  its devas and humans.

This is what the Blessed One said. Elated  ̓  the bhikkhus of the group of five delighted in the Blessed One’s statement.

And while this discourse was being spoken  ̓  there arose in the Venerable Kondañña the dust-free  ̓  stainless vision of the Dhamma:

“Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.”

And when the Wheel of the Dhamma had been set in motion by the Blessed One, the earth-dwelling devas raised a cry:

“At Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana  ̓  this unsurpassed Wheel of the Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One  ̓  which cannot be stopped by any ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”

Having heard the cry of the earth-dwelling devas  ̓  the devas of the realm of the Four Great Kings raised a cry …

Having heard the cry of the devas of the realm of the Four Great Kings  ̓  the Tāvatiṁsa devas raised a cry …

Having heard the cry of the Tāvatiṁsa devas  ̓  the Yāma devas raised a cry …

Having heard the cry of the Yāma devas  ̓  the Tusita devas raised a cry …

Having heard the cry of the Tusita devas  ̓  the Nimmānaratī devas raised a cry …

Having heard the cry of the Nimmānaratī devas  ̓  the Paranimmitavasavattī devas raised a cry …

Having heard the cry of the Paranimmitavasavattī devas  ̓  the devas of Brahmā’s company raised a cry:

“At Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana  ̓  this unsurpassed Wheel of the Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One  ̓  which cannot be stopped by any ascetic or brahmin or deva or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”

Thus at that moment  ̓  at that instant  ̓  at that second  ̓  the cry spread as far as the brahmā world  ̓  and this ten thousandfold world system shook  ̓  quaked  ̓  and trembled  ̓  and an immeasurable glorious radiance appeared in the world surpassing the divine majesty of the devas.

Then the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance:

“Koṇḍañña has indeed understood! Koṇḍañña has indeed understood!”

In this way the Venerable Koṇḍañña acquired the name “Aññā Koṇḍañña—Koṇḍañña Who Has Understood.”

Bhikkhus form is not-self. If form were self  ̓  then form would not lead to affliction  ̓  and one could command to form: “Let my form be thus  ̓  let my form not be thus.”

But since form is not-self  ̓  it leads to affliction  ̓  and none can command to form: “Let my form be thus  ̓  let my form not be thus.”

Feeling is not-self. If feeling were self  ̓  then feeling would not lead to affliction  ̓  and one could command to feeling: “Let my feeling be thus  ̓  let my feeling not be thus.”

But since feeling is not-self  ̓  it leads to affliction  ̓  and none can command to feeling: “Let my feeling be thus  ̓  let my feeling not be thus.”

Perception is not-self. If perception were self  ̓  then perception would not lead to affliction  ̓  and one could command to perception: “Let my perception be thus  ̓  let my perception not be thus.”

But since perception is not-self  ̓  it leads to affliction  ̓  and none can command to perception: “Let my perception be thus  ̓  let my perception not be thus.”

Volitional formations are not-self. If volitional formations were self  ̓  then volitional formations would not lead to affliction  ̓  and one could command to volitional formations: “Let my volitional formations be thus  ̓  let my volitional formations not be thus.”

But since volitional formations are not-self  ̓  they lead to affliction  ̓  and none can command to volitional formations: “Let my volitional formations be thus  ̓  let my volitional formations not be thus.”

Consciousness is not-self. If consciousness were self  ̓  then consciousness would not lead to affliction  ̓  and one could command to consciousness: “Let my consciousness be thus  ̓  let my consciousness not be thus.”

But since consciousness is not-self  ̓  it leads to affliction  ̓  and none can command to consciousness: “Let my consciousness be thus  ̓  let my consciousness not be thus.”

[Bhikkhus what do you think:] “Is form permanent or impermanent?”

“Impermanent venerable Sir.”

“Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?” “Unsatisfactory venerable Sir.”

“Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine  ̓  this I am  ̓  this is my self?'”

“No venerable Sir.”

Bhikkhus what do you think: “Is feeling permanent or impermanent?”

“Impermanent venerable Sir.”

“Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?” “Unsatisfactory venerable Sir.”

“Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine  ̓  this I am  ̓  this is my self?'”

“No venerable Sir.”

Bhikkhus what do you think: “Is perception permanent or impermanent?” “Impermanent venerable Sir.”

“Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?” “Unsatisfactory venerable Sir.”

“Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine  ̓  this I am  ̓  this is my self?'

“No venerable Sir.”

Bhikkhus what do you think: “Are volitional formations permanent or impermanent?”

“Impermanent venerable Sir.”

“Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?” “Unsatisfactory venerable Sir.”

“Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine  ̓  this I am  ̓  this is my self?'”

“No venerable Sir.”

Bhikkhus what do you think: “Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?”

“Impermanent venerable Sir.”

“Is what is impermanent satisfactory or unsatisfactory?” “Unsatisfactory venerable Sir.”

“Is what is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine  ̓  this I am  ̓  this is my self?'

“No venerable Sir.”

[Therefore bhikkhus] any kind of form whatsoever  ̓  whether past future or present  ̓  internal or external  ̓  gross or subtle  ̓  inferior or superior  ̓  far or near  ̓  must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: “This is not mine  ̓  this I am not  ̓  this is not my self.”

Any kind of feeling whatsoever  ̓  whether past future or present  ̓  internal or external  ̓  gross or subtle  ̓  inferior or superior  ̓  far or near  ̓  must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: “This is not mine  ̓  this I am not  ̓  this is not my self.”

Any kind of perception whatsoever  ̓  whether past future or present  ̓  internal or external  ̓  gross or subtle  ̓  inferior or superior  ̓  far or near  ̓  must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: “This is not mine  ̓  this I am not  ̓  this is not my self.”

Any kind of volitional formation whatsoever  ̓  whether past future or present  ̓  internal or external  ̓  gross or subtle  ̓  inferior or superior  ̓  far or near  ̓  must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: “This is not mine  ̓  this I am not  ̓  this is not my self.”

Any kind of consciousness whatsoever  ̓  whether past future or present  ̓  internal or external  ̓  gross or subtle  ̓  inferior or superior  ̓  far or near  ̓  must be seen with right wisdom as it really is: “This is not mine  ̓  this I am not  ̓  this is not my self.”

[Bhikkhus when a noble discipleii]  ̓  who has heard the teachingiii sees thus  ̓  he becomes disenchanted with form  ̓  becomes disenchanted with feeling  ̓  becomes disenchanted with perception  ̓  becomes disenchanted with volitional formations  ̓  becomes disenchanted with consciousness.

When he is disenchanted passion fades away. With the fading of passion he is liberated. When liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated. He understands: “Birth is exhausted  ̓  the holy life is fulfilled  ̓  what has to be done is done  ̓  there is nothing else to do for the sake of liberation.”iv

That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus of the group of five were glad and they approved of his words. Now during this utterance  ̓  the hearts of the bhikkhus of the group of five  ̓  were liberated from the taints through the cessation of clinging.

## The Buddha's First Exclamation<a id="fire-sermon"></a>

[Thus have I heard] on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Gayā  ̓  at Gayā’s Head  ̓  together with a thousand bhikkhus. There he addressed the bhikkhus:

Bhikkhus all is burning!

And what bhikkhus is the all that is burning?

Bhikkhus the eye is burning  ̓  forms are burning  ̓  eye-consciousness is burning  ̓  eye-contact is burning  ̓  and what is felt as pleasant or painful  ̓  or neither-painful-nor-pleasant  ̓  that arises from eye-contact as its condition  ̓  that too is burning.

Burning with what?

Burning with the fire of lust  ̓  with the fire of hate  ̓  with the fire of delusion.

I say it is burning with birth  ̓  ageing and death  ̓  with sorrows  ̓  with lamentations  ̓  with pains  ̓  with displeasures  ̓  with despairs.

The ear is burning  ̓  sounds are burning  ̓  ear-consciousness is burning  ̓  ear-contact is burning  ̓  and what is felt as pleasant or painful  ̓  or neither-painful-nor-pleasant  ̓  that arises from ear-contact as its condition  ̓  that too is burning.

The nose is burning  ̓  odours are burning  ̓  nose-consciousness is burning  ̓  nose-contact is burning  ̓  and what is felt as pleasant or painful  ̓  or neither-painful-nor-pleasant  ̓  that arises from nose-contact as its condition  ̓  that too is burning.

[Bhikkhus when a noble disciple]  ̓  who has heard the teaching sees thus  ̓  he becomes disenchanted with the eye  ̓  becomes disenchanted with forms  ̓  becomes disenchanted with eye-consciousness  ̓  becomes disenchanted with eye-contact  ̓  and what is felt as pleasant or painful  ̓  or neither-painful-nor-pleasant  ̓  that arises from eye-contact as its condition  ̓  with that too he becomes disenchanted.

** Pāli Phonetics & Pronunciation
#+begin_src markdown :tangle ./manuscript/markdown/appendix/phonetics-pronunciation.md

# Pāli Phonetics and Pronunciation

Pāli is the official scriptural language of Theravāda Buddhism. It is closely related to Sanskrit, with no written script of its own. Written forms have emerged in the scripts of other languages (e.g. Devanāgarī, Sinhala, Burmese, Khmer, Thai, Roman). The Roman script used here is pronounced just as one would expect, with the following clarifications:

**Vowels**\
**a** as in magm**a** **ā** as in f**a**ther\
**i** as in **i**ll **ī** as in l**i**ter\
**u** as in p**u**t **ū** as in h**u**la hoop\
**e** as in Santa F**e** **o** as in f**o**r

Long vowels are pronounced as above, but are held for twice the length of their short counterparts. By default **e** and **o** are long vowels, but they become short if followed by double consonants e.g. *mettā*, ,*sotthi*. In such a case they are pronounced short as in "pet" and "soft" respectively.

Contrary to English language, Pāli does not contain diphthongs i.e. a combination of two vowels in a single syllable, in which the sound begins as one vowel and moves towards another (as in coin, loud, and side). Pāli vowels therefore sound more similar to the vowels **a**, ,**e**, **i**, **o**, **u** of e.g. German language.

## Consonants

Pāli consonants are mostly pronounced as one would expect, but with a few additional rules: Two-lettered notations with **h** (e.g. **kh**, ,**ch**, **ṭh**, **th**, **ḷh**, **ph**) denote an aspirated, airy sound, and should be considered as one unit. They are distinct from the hard, crisp sound of a single consonant (e.g. **k**, **c**, **ṭ**, **t**, ,**p**). However, other combinations with **h**, e.g., **mh**, **ñh**, and **vh**, do count as two consonants (e.g. 'jivhā'or 'taṇhā'). Examples: **th** as in "Thomas" (never pronounced as in "the"); **ph** as in palate (never pronounced as in "photo"). Double consonants are pronounced with a pause before releasing the consonant e.g. kk as in bookkeeper.

,**ḍ**, **ḍh**, **ḷ**, **ḷh**, **ṇ**, **ṭ**, **ṭh**\
These retroflex consonants have no English equivalents. They are formed by curling the tip of the tongue back against the palate.

## Miscellaneous

The semivowel "**v**" is pronounced as in "**w**e"; "**ñ**" is pronounced as in "ca**ny**on"; the pure nasal "**ṁ**" and voiced nasal "**ṅ**" are pronounced as in "su**ng**".

As an aid to understanding, **hyphens** (-) have often been inserted in longer Pāli compounds, in order to indicate the separate words that make up the compound. This should not affect the pronunciation during recitation in any way. In order to not suggest unintended pauses in the flow of the recitation, punctuation marks (commas, periods, colons and semicolons) were removed for most chants. **Line breaks** within a sentence indicate that a short breathing pause is inserted, but indented line breaks indicate that recitation continues without a breathing pause.

Elsewhere, **breath marks** (  ) have been inserted in order to indicate breathing pauses. When reciting as a group, each participant is encouraged to recite as accurately, audibly, and continuously as within one's capabilities; ideally from the first chant to the last without interruption, gaps, or omissions. However, passages within **brackets**  \...  serve as an introduction, and are recited only by the leader. Except for Pāli protection and funeral chants, there is a breathing pause after  \...  , before the rest of the group joins in.

** Chanting Leader Guidelines
#+begin_src markdown :tangle ./manuscript/markdown/appendix/guidelines.md

# Chanting Leader Guidelines

It is both a great honour and also a great responsibility to lead a group of fellow Dhamma practitioners through Dhamma recitations. These guidelines provide tips that can help facilitate a smooth and enjoyable experience for the group of participants, as well as for the chanting leader himself.

The following points should be considered:
- Accurate Pāli Pronunciation
- Sufficient Audibility and Volume
- Determining a Suitable Tempo
- Tempo Consistency
- Determining a Suitable Pitch
- Pitch Consistency
- Continuity

## Accurate Pāli Pronunciation

Within the domain of Pāli pronunciation, the chanting leader shall take special care of long and short syllables, since this would otherwise result in a disunited recitation with those who do take care of long and short syllables. To obtain good Pāli pronunciation, frequently chanting with those who have good pronunciation, or listening and chant along with audio recordings of well-pronounced Pāli recitations, can go a long way. This helps to identify and even out idiosyncrasies that may have arisen. Of course, all other elements of accurate Pāli pronunciation too shall be integrated as much as possible (voiceless vs. voiced, aspirate vs. non-aspirate consonants etc.), but the difference between long and short syllables is the most important one in the present context.

## Sufficient Audibility and Volume

In order for others to be able to follow the chanting style of the chanting leader accurately, it is tantamount that he is clearly audible. The voice of the chanting leader should be louder than that of the loudest group member, so that others can follow the chanting leader's lead with ease, rather than having to make an effort to find his voice. This is not to say that the chanting leader needs to blast everyone to such a degree that only his voice can be heard. This would defeat the purpose of group recitation. As often in Dhamma practice, a healthy balance between extremes needs to be found. However, when in doubt it is preferable if the chanting leader errs on the side of 'too loud', rather than 'too soft'. Both newcomers, as well as those who have memorized the chants, but are not yet fully proficient in their recollection of the chants, benefit greatly from a chanting leader whose voice has a decent volume and is clearly audible. While some individuals naturally have a voice that resonates strongly, or have trained their voice to that extent, those who are not so disposed may use a microphone for support. Using a microphone also allows the chanting leader to recite in a more relaxed manner, rather than having to constantly make sure that his voice carries to all corners of the room or hall. For chanting periods that take more than 20 minutes, there is a tendency for one's voice to become softer and thus less penetrating compared to the beginning of the chanting session. Again, a microphone or increased effort can help to remedy this tendency.

## Determining a Suitable Tempo

Everyone has a preferred tempo at which one finds it pleasant to recite. It is helpful for the chanting leader to choose a tempo that allows him to maintain a clear pronunciation of Pāli terms. Even if one is able to chant accurately at high speed, it would be very difficult for newcomers and those who are not familiar with Pāli, to follow along. Pāli is not our mother tongue, and fluent reading requires a lot of skill and practice. It is therefore important when chanting with others, to choose a tempo that they can follow along comfortably, without causing them to feel stressed by the end of the chant, as if having participated in a rap battle. Choosing a more meditative pace also allows the mind to process the Dhamma while reciting it; a task that is not easy for beginners. Nonethless, slowing down helps greatly to allow for reflections and insights to arise during Dhamma recitation. At the same time, if the pace is too slow, some individuals may feel bored, or even fall asleep. Again, the right tempo usually lies somewhere between the extremes. Private recitation in one's kuṭi or walking path, undertaken for the sake of maintaining chants in memory by rehearsing them from time to time, is usually done much faster than how one would recite with a group. This allows one to rehearse large amounts of texts in short time, which is useful when wanting to maintain a large body of chants in memory. In contrast, group recitation should follow a more moderate pace, to fulfill the earlier mentioned objectives.

A regular chanting leader may ask for feedback from others, whether they find his chanting tempo comfortable to chant along with, or whether they find it too fast or slow. The experience of newcomers should find special consideration.

## Tempo Consistency

Once a suitable tempo has been chosen to start one's recitation (see previous point), it may be challenging to maintain the chosen tempo throughout the chant, or even throughout the entire chanting session. For most individuals there is a natural tendency to tempo up as time goes by. It is the chanting leader's task to prevent that from happening, unless he finds out that the speed he has chosen at the beginning of the chant is too fast or slow for himself and/or others. The ideal time for tempo adjustments is between two chants; not during a chant. The introduction line e.g. "Handa mayaṁ\...", or "Evaṁ me sutaṁ" can be used as an indicator for how fast or slow the chanting leader wants to recite, whereas the rest of the group shall follow whatever tempo the chanting leader has chosen. If another group member, especially one with a strong and predominant voice has a tendency to change tempo midway, or lengthen/shorten/skip syllables due to inaccurate Pāli pronunciation, the chanting leader must not follow his lead. If this is a recurrent problem with a particular group member, it is worthwhile to talk to him privately and request if he would be willing to chant more softly, so that other group members can more accurately and easily follow the chanting leader's lead.

## Determining a Suitable Pitch

Much of what has been stated in the chapters about chanting tempo, applies equally to one's chanting pitch. Everyone has his own preferred pitch, at which his voice sounds most natural and requires the least effort to produce sound. It is helpful for the chanting leader to choose a pitch that is not too far from his natural pitch; otherwise it can become very exhausting, especially when recitation continues for longer periods. However, a certain degree of adjustment may be necessary on the part of the chanting leader, if his natural pitch happens to be far outside the average person's range. Whether it is very high or very low, it can be difficult for others to tune in to, if the chanting leader's pitch is very different from their own. A regular chanting leader can learn by asking for feedback from others, as to whether they find his pitch comfortable to chant along with, or whether they find it too high or too low. If it turns out that many people point out they find his pitch to be very high or low, he may deliberately adjust his pitch, while still remaining within his own comfort zone. Listening to a reference note before starting to recite, may be helpful for the chanting leader to hit the right pitch every time. A musical ear too can help, but this is very difficult to train; some even claim it's impossible to develop. Someone who aspires to polish his skills in this area and would like to learn one or two tricks for how to find his own comfortable pitch every time he starts to lead a chant, can privately approach me for some guidance.

## Pitch Consistency

Once a suitable pitch has been chosen to start one's recitation (see previous point), it can be a challenging task to maintain the chosen pitch throughout the chant, what more throughout the entire chanting session. For many individuals there is a natural tendency to gradually drag the pitch lower and lower as time goes by. It is the chanting leader's task to prevent that from happening, unless he feels that the pitch he has chosen at the beginning of the chant is too high or low for himself and/or others. In this case, the ideal time for making pitch corrections, is between two chants. The introduction line e.g. "Handa mayaṁ\..." sets the tone, whereby the rest of the group shall tune in at whatever pitch the chanting leader has chosen. Once a certain pitch has been started, try to maintain it throughout the chant. If another group member, especially one with a strong and predominant voice, has a tendency to change pitch midway, try not to follow his lead but keep chanting in the original pitch. If this is a recurrent problem with a particular group member, it is worthwhile to talk to him privately and request if he would be willing to chant more softly, so that other group members can more accurately and easily follow the chanting leader's lead.

## Continuity

Individuals who do not know how to recite a particular text due to moderate prior exposure, as well as those who have memorized a text poorly, rely heavily on the chanting leader. They benefit greatly from a chanting leader whose voice can be heard throughout the entire chant. Continuity can be difficult to maintain when there is a need to breathe at places other than those when there is a breath mark, or when having to cough. At such times a chanting leader can help the group by choosing his pauses skilfully. It is particularly at the beginning of sentences/lines that certain group members may get stuck due to a lapse of memory. It is here when the voice of the chanting leader can be very helpful to get them back on track. Likewise, at the end of long lines/sentences, the chanting leader's voice is important. Some members of the group may have run out of breath midway, and may therfore skip the last few words and start chanting again only at the next line, whereupon one may notice that the overall volume has decreased towards the end of the sentence. Here too it is important that at least the chanting leader continues until the very end of the sentence. The importance of the chanting leader's voice to be present at the beginning and end of the line/sentence, makes the middle of the sentence the ideal time for a short breathing break for him, if necessary. In the middle of sentences, the absence of his voice may barely be noticed, since the rest of the group keeps the chant going. The second-best choice for a short break is the end of the line, whereas for the beginning of lines it is an absolute must for the chanting leader's voice to be present. In this way he helps to keep the chant going without interruption, and those who recite by heart can trust and rely on the chanting leader's voice for their support.

## Summary

The above points and principles are meant to function as a guideline for aspiring chanting leaders to make their own experience as smooth as possible, without having to be stressed or insecure about making mistakes. Moreover, the rest of the group benefits from well-trained chanting leaders, who give their fellow Saṅgha members a sense of ease and comfort while reciting the words of the Buddha, allowing them to reflect on the meaning along the way. After all, recitation of the Dhamma is one of the gateways to liberation (AN 5.209).

Thanks to all Saṅgha members who are willing to share thisresponsibility, by taking turns as chanting leaders.
